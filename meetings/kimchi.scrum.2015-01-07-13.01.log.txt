13:10:42 <alinefm> #topic Open Discussion
13:11:08 <alinefm> I have only one topic today related to my email asking for Linux distro focal points
13:12:04 <alinefm> the focal point will be responsible for testing, reporting issues and sending patches when a problem is found in a specific distro
13:12:58 <alinefm> so feel free to choose which distro you'd like
13:13:11 <royce> I recently switched to FC20 because ISAM issue :(
13:13:51 <royce> I can take this distro only now...
13:15:41 <ramonn> i am able to install suse on my laptop
13:15:43 <ramonn> *opensuse
13:15:54 <ramonn> ibm has openclient for this one?
13:16:17 <wenwang> I am using fedora 21 now and works just fine
13:16:58 <royce> I couldn't properly install openclient on Ubuntu 14.10... Others encountered this?
13:16:59 <alinefm> ramonn, you don't need to reinstall your laptop - you can create a vm and test kimchi with nested virt
13:17:15 <alinefm> royce, I installed it some weeks ago
13:17:37 <alinefm> I needed to do the manual install to get everything working fine
13:20:02 <royce> Just let it go~Installing these bothers:P
13:20:30 <royce> alinefm, about upload: I will send the test script against real model/kimchi server tomorrow so reviewer can try it, but for mock test I think we can only do a basic one against REST API not against the upload logic, what do you think?
13:21:10 <alinefm> royce, agree
13:21:23 <alinefm> in the test refactoring I am doing all tests by REST API
13:21:34 <alinefm> so we can eliminate almost all the mock tests
13:21:51 <alinefm> royce, but as it will take some time to get it done, do that way you proposed
13:23:23 <royce> Do you mean not mock the upload, alinefm?
13:25:05 <alinefm> royce, yes
13:25:33 <royce> I meant to propose it against a mock one because real upload can be time consuming
13:26:09 <royce> when we want to upload a 100M file, e.g.
13:26:13 <alinefm> are you testing with bug files?
13:26:19 <royce> yes
13:26:19 <alinefm> oh... ok
13:27:01 <ramonn> ok, so i can handle opensuse alinefm
13:27:04 <royce> Do you think we need to include test a big file?
13:27:44 <alinefm> ramonn, please, reply to ML to everyone be aware about it
13:27:56 <alinefm> royce, I think it is good as we had problems with big files
13:28:04 <royce> I think file such as 100M is OK, but 1G really takes more than 30s
13:29:04 <alinefm> royce, I think 30s is fine as only developers run the tests
13:29:25 <alinefm> you can only insert a message informing the upload test will start and can take some time to finish
13:29:58 <royce> OK, we can give it a try
13:31:34 <alinefm> any other topic?
13:34:17 <alinefm> alright...
13:34:29 <alinefm> thanks everyone for joining!
