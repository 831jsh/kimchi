13:12:02 <alinefm> #topic Open Discussion
13:12:21 <alinefm> ramonn, do you want to share your thoughts about sensor monitor?
13:12:56 <ramonn> alinefm, well, i agree with the choice of the team: add unit for each sensor
13:13:18 <ramonn> alinefm, the main issue was not notice that some sensors monitors multiple devices
13:13:18 <samhenri> I had created a patch long time ago but It was just a temporary fix for the UI
13:13:50 <samhenri> But I noticed that the api was returning incorrect values some times
13:14:40 <pvital> some times? you are very nice samhenri
13:14:47 <pvital> :-P
13:14:47 <alinefm> ramonn, and the unit needs to be different according to the device?
13:14:58 <samhenri> I mean, the only real input I receive are the core temperatures
13:15:03 <alinefm> ramonn, what is the issue there?
13:15:14 <samhenri> But the hdd and other devices are random
13:15:40 <ramonn> alinefm, the issue was using incorrectly units for devices
13:15:49 <ramonn> like use RPM for measure power (must be in W)
13:16:13 <ramonn> alinefm, this was caused because the code understand that a sensor only monitor 1 kind of device
13:16:57 <alinefm> so what is your proposal?
13:17:40 <ramonn> alinefm, just sent two proposals: group sensors by correct unit OR return unit for each sensor
13:17:43 <lagarcia> ramonn, do you have an example of a sensor that monitors more than one thing?
13:17:46 <ramonn> the second one is stronger on the list
13:18:21 <ramonn> lagarcia, yeap, http://pastebin.hursley.ibm.com/4858
13:18:56 <lagarcia> ramonn, ?
13:18:56 <alinefm> ramonn, please, use an open pastebin
13:19:02 <ramonn> sorry
13:19:05 <lagarcia> ramonn, I see only one thing per sensor
13:19:11 <alinefm> fpaste.org
13:19:12 <rotru> alinefm,  I have some points later
13:19:18 <alinefm> rotru, ok
13:19:29 <ramonn> lagarcia, alinefm http://pastebin.com/2QBXDzZr
13:19:31 <lagarcia> ramonn, I mean, one measurement per sensor
13:19:48 <ramonn> lagarcia, nop, if you see ibmpowernv-isa-0000, there is fans and power on the sensor
13:20:11 <lagarcia> ramonn, well... ibmpowernv-isa-0000 is not one sensor afaict
13:20:19 <lagarcia> ramonn, each entry is a different sensor
13:20:21 <ramonn> lagarcia, but thats the way the code sees it
13:20:31 <lagarcia> ramonn, ah, ok... so the code is clearly wrong :)
13:20:52 <ramonn> yeap
13:21:09 <lagarcia> ramonn, ok. understood. thx.
13:21:09 <lcorreia> that makes sensor!
13:21:15 <lagarcia> haha
13:21:21 <danielhb> lcorreia, HAHAHAHHAHAAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAH
13:21:23 <alinefm> hehehe
13:21:50 <alinefm> ramonn, according to your suggestions how the API JSON will look like?
13:21:59 <transhuman_> hi was somone in hear looking for me? Cant find where someone posted to me, but its flashing! I have been busy with work and so haven't been working on this for the last week
13:22:02 <ramonn> lcorreia, LOL
13:22:19 <danielhb> lcorreia, https://youtu.be/CduA0TULnow?t=88
13:22:46 <ramonn> alinefm, http://pastebin.com/AED84ABL
13:22:55 <ramonn> add unit to the dict for each device
13:23:47 <lcorreia> danielhb, lol
13:24:30 <rotru> transhuman_,  hi, not sure :)
13:25:45 <rotru> ramonn,  yeap , I think each data  should have its unit
13:26:09 <alinefm> danielhb, ^
13:26:19 <alinefm> ramonn, I am Ok with that
13:26:29 <rotru> ramonn,  or block of data
13:26:43 * rotru is not 100% sure about the return today
13:27:58 <rotru> ramonn, once API return is going to change, you will have to interact with UI folks to fix front-end properly .... decide the data return as soon as possible and send to them
13:28:04 <danielhb> alinefm, ramonn there's an RFC discussion about that already. Perhaps we can carry it on there
13:28:16 <ramonn> yeap
13:28:38 <alinefm> danielhb, why do not use the scrum to get a faster feedback?
13:30:09 <danielhb> alinefm, we can use it, sure. But the discussion already started in the RFC and I see no point asking lcorreia  and pvital and myself to repeat ourselves here
13:30:52 <alinefm> danielhb, so the conclusion is ...?
13:30:58 <alinefm> how the sensors API will be?
13:31:13 <pvital> option 2 of the RFC
13:31:15 <pvital> :-P
13:31:30 <danielhb> pvital gets it
13:31:53 <alinefm> as you have already discussed in the ML and don; t want to do it again here I hope you have a conclusion on that
13:32:00 <alinefm> and ramonn is not blocked on that anymore
13:32:48 <danielhb> alinefm, we can discuss it here fine. I just don't see why we can't carry on with what we already started in the ML
13:33:22 <alinefm> danielhb, why postpone a discussion if we have time to do it now?
13:33:56 <danielhb> alinefm, alright. ramonn , pvital and lcorreia , please share your RFC thoughts here
13:34:16 <alinefm> ramonn and pvital have already done that =)
13:35:00 <lcorreia> yes, I agree with RFC option 2
13:36:16 <alinefm> danielhb, what about you?
13:36:36 <danielhb> RFC option 2
13:36:40 <alinefm> \o/
13:36:54 <alinefm> danielhb, it didn't hurt, huh?!
13:37:02 <danielhb> RFC option 2 is '2) Show unit for each sensor. '
13:37:27 <alinefm> danielhb, yeap - ramonn have already explained the 2 options in the beginning of this conversation
13:37:31 <lcorreia> we are all unit-ed!
13:37:41 <alinefm> heheh
13:37:54 <alinefm> rotru, what is your topic for today?
13:38:09 <rotru> alinefm,  I have 3 actually:
13:38:24 <rotru> 1- [WOK] Wok command line options does not follow a pattern... some have '-'  others have '_' in the name. We need a task to fix this and also check if there are new options we can include or that are missing. I would like to work on this;
13:38:24 <rotru> 2- [Ginger] Ginger SPEC file are not ok yet IMHO. I was talking to ramonn and the spec is making wokd restart 2 times when the package is update, this is not good. Ramon and I had some ideas and we can fix this. Need to create an ISSUE ??
13:38:24 <rotru> 3- [Kimchi] The Guests UI is not recognizing VMs in states like 'PAUSED' this makes UI looks weird and is not possible to open any VM console in the browser. I wonder whether this issue is known by UI folks: socorro, samhenri, peterpennings;
13:38:55 <danielhb> alinefm, doesn't hurt to read and answer the RFC either :P
13:39:05 <rotru> danielhb, alinefm  focus
13:39:44 <alinefm> rotru, about 1) OK! we also need to check if the manpage doc is updated with the latest changes on wokd command
13:40:14 <rotru> alinefm, can I create a issue-resquest ? or do you do this  ?
13:40:25 <alinefm> rotru, please, do
13:40:30 <rotru> ok
13:40:52 <alinefm> about 2) it would be good to have a single solution for all the plugins
13:41:03 <alinefm> I am not sure but maybe it is a common plugin among all them
13:41:26 <alinefm> and restart wokd on package update is not a good approach from a user perspective
13:41:30 <rotru> alinefm,  common "problem" ?
13:41:44 <alinefm> correct =)
13:42:08 <alinefm> in fact, restarting wokd while updating plugin package may broken the packages update feature from gingerbae
13:42:11 <alinefm> *gingerbase
13:42:24 <rotru> alinefm,  yeap
13:42:35 <peterpennings> rotru, about 3. This problem is new for me, I'll take a look
13:43:06 <rotru> alinefm,  like you, ramonn and I  were discussing ... lets check the fedora/ubuntu/debian guidelines
13:43:08 <alinefm> rotru, about 3. open an issue and I will assign to peterpennings
13:43:20 <alinefm> rotru, yeap - it is a good point of start
13:44:04 <rotru> alinefm,  then, we can make an approach that will help to deliver the packages to that distros as well
13:44:21 <rotru> alinefm,  about 3, ok
13:44:37 <rotru> alinefm,  should I open an issue of 2 as well /???
13:45:27 <alinefm> rotru, it is up to you
13:45:57 <rotru> alinefm,  asking because i am not sure if there are issues already open, tracking RPM/DEB packages
13:46:14 <rotru> alinefm, will check ...
13:46:23 <rotru> ok, so 3 issues to open :)
13:47:02 <rotru> ramonn,  do you want to work on "2" with me ?
13:47:20 <ramonn> rotru, yeap
13:47:29 <rotru> ramonn,  cool
13:47:43 <ramonn> rotru, i like your suggestion yesterday, after reading the guidelines, we can improve the fix
13:49:02 <rotru> alinefm,  thats all from my side  :)
13:49:07 <alinefm> thanks, rotru
13:49:11 <alinefm> anything else for today?
13:49:26 <rotru> alinefm,  who manages kimchi-bot  ?
13:49:34 <ramonn> nop
13:49:41 <alinefm> rotru, me
13:49:50 <rotru> ok
13:50:07 <rotru> alinefm,  where does it run ?
13:50:17 <alinefm> in my laptop
13:50:20 <alinefm> it is a meetingbot plugin
13:50:38 <rotru> alinefm,  ok
13:50:46 <alinefm> I have a configuration file to join a specific IRC server and channel e log the meeting to be upload to github
13:50:53 <alinefm> *and log...
13:51:42 <rotru> alinefm,  does it log only "#info" lines ?
13:52:02 <alinefm> no
13:52:47 <rotru> ok ok thanks :)
13:53:06 <alinefm> it logs everything from #startmeeting to #endmeeting
13:53:30 <alinefm> the lines with specific commands, eg, #info, #topic, are filtered out in some log files
13:53:33 <danielhb> I have one more thing
13:53:36 <alinefm> for example: http://kimchi-project.github.io/kimchi/meetings/kimchi.scrum.2016-04-27-13.01.html
13:54:05 <alinefm> rotru, but all the meeting is recorded in another file: http://kimchi-project.github.io/kimchi/meetings/kimchi.scrum.2016-04-27-13.01.log.html
13:54:12 <alinefm> danielhb, go ahead
13:54:21 <danielhb> I urge everyone interested to review " [Gingerbase] netinfo.py: merging Ginger and Kimchi versions​" due to its impact in both plug-ins
13:54:40 <danielhb> And no, I will not by any means copy/paste the patch here for discussion <--- ramonn pvital
13:54:54 <rotru> hehe
13:54:58 <lcorreia> :)
13:55:16 <alinefm> danielhb, will do that after meeting
13:55:44 <danielhb> alinefm, thx!
13:56:29 <alinefm> is that all for today?
13:56:38 <rotru> yes
13:57:01 <danielhb> yes, send it home
13:57:15 <alinefm> thanks everyone for joining!
