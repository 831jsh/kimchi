13:18:54 <alinefm> let's move to open discussion
13:19:01 <alinefm> #topic Open Discussion
13:19:07 <alinefm> baude, do you want to start?
13:19:27 <baude> i think we are cool w/the jquery stuff, ill just get the exception for the time being
13:19:38 <baude> when you have the license stuff cleaned up, let me know
13:19:53 <alinefm> sure
13:20:08 <baude> and do you have a reasonably clean system to test with? meaning all the rpm deps are not installed?
13:20:10 <alinefm> YuXin, from the list you sent, is there any jquery file we can remove?
13:20:27 <alinefm> baude, I have clean VM's for it =)
13:20:33 <baude> alinefm, perfect
13:20:58 <YuXin> ./css/theme-default/jquery-ui.custom.css       -- css file for kimchi jquery ui plugin
13:20:59 <YuXin> ./libs/jquery-ui.min.js		-- jquery ui js file
13:20:59 <YuXin> ./libs/jquery-ui-i18n.min.js		-- jquery ui resource bundles
13:20:59 <YuXin> ./libs/themes/base/jquery-ui.min.css		-- jquery ui css file
13:20:59 <YuXin> below has duplicate
13:20:59 <YuXin> ./libs/jquery-1.10.0.min.js
13:20:59 <YuXin> ./js/jquery.min.js
13:21:01 <YuXin> ./js/jquery-ui.js
13:21:14 <YuXin> there are some duplicate file
13:21:26 <YuXin> I will look into it and get duplicate file removed
13:22:23 <alinefm> YuXin, that would be great! thanks
13:22:48 <wenwang> Also I think I have one loading picture that is not used any more. I will send a patch to remove it
13:23:20 <alinefm> wenwang, please, check all the images and remove those we dont use anymore
13:23:46 <wenwang> alinefm: No problem
13:25:01 <alinefm> any other topic team?
13:26:31 <wenwang> I tested kimchi on iPad today according to issue#395 VM console does not work on iPads which I cannot connect to vnc server on ipad to reproduce the bug
13:27:08 <alinefm> wenwang, really?
13:27:24 <alinefm> kimchi server and ipad are in the same network?
13:27:40 <alinefm> I've already tested on android phones and it connects well
13:27:44 <wenwang> alinefm: Yes. YuXin and shaohef are with me
13:27:58 <wenwang> alinefm: sure
13:28:17 <YuXin> kimchi can be loaded, but web socket connection failed in vnc.html
13:28:26 <shaohef> alinefm: seems it can connect on old kimchi version.
13:28:48 <alinefm> shaohef, well, we need to fix it ASAP so
13:29:08 <alinefm> wenwang, YuXin, shaohef, so you logged into kimchi on IPAD but the vnc does not open?
13:29:09 <shaohef> alinefm: we are trying to use "git bisect" to find the bad point.
13:29:18 <alinefm> the connection with websockts fails?
13:29:49 <YuXin> vnc.html can open, but it failed to load vm screen
13:30:10 <shaohef> alinefm: report  __stl.c  error
13:30:24 <wenwang> alinefm: Yes, the page shows "disconnected"
13:31:29 <alinefm> what is the distro?
13:31:36 <alinefm> and browser? safari?
13:31:59 <YuXin> redhat, both chrom and safari are tried
13:32:11 <wenwang> IOS 5.1 , both safari and chrome won't work
13:33:22 <alinefm> have you had a chance to test on android?
13:33:36 <YuXin> not tried on android
13:34:14 <alinefm> I will do some investigation on android today and let you know
13:34:15 <YuXin> we can try kimchi 1.2.0 or 1.2.1 to see whether there is such an issue
13:34:23 <shaohef> on android tablet
13:34:26 <alinefm> who is working to fix it?
13:34:47 <alinefm> if someone
13:34:48 <YuXin> wang wen, shao he and I will continue to look into it tomorrow
13:34:57 <alinefm> ok
13:35:41 <alinefm> YuXin, shaohef, wenwang, the problem is with spice and novnc? or just novnc?
13:35:54 <shaohef> novnc
13:36:21 <YuXin> shaohe, we have not tried spice, right?
13:37:44 <shaohef> no
13:37:54 <shaohef> we can try it tomorrow
13:38:50 <YuXin> when I tried the windows vm console on desktop, the mouse pointer can not be aligned
13:39:15 <YuXin> there are always 2 mouse pointers, one is inside vnc screen and the other is outside
13:39:52 <alinefm> I've already seen it on opensuse vm too
13:40:41 <YuXin> the vnc screen has not taken the whole viewport of brower
13:41:21 <shaohef> YuXin: Dose it can reproduce on virt-manger? add a absolute position for mouse in virt-manager, and try again.
13:41:43 <YuXin> not tried
13:42:19 <YuXin> aline, recently there is a patch to change 0.0.0. to 127.0.0.1
13:42:44 <YuXin> this will prevent all other vnc tools from access vm, right?
13:42:58 <alinefm> from outside host machine, yes
13:43:18 <YuXin> why we prevent other tools?
13:43:47 <alinefm> to don't expose the vm console to anyone
13:44:01 <alinefm> but you can still use other too if you have access to the host
13:44:16 <alinefm> there is -via option to vncviewer for example
13:44:23 <alinefm> vianac, do you remember how to use it ^?
13:45:16 <YuXin> I think this will harm the consumability  of vms created by kimchi
13:45:30 <vianac> alinefm, vncviewer -via <remote host IP> localhost:<port>
13:46:03 <vianac> assuming that the VNC is running in "localhost" from the <remote host IP>
13:46:18 <alinefm> vianac, thanks! yeah that is the scenario
13:46:40 <YuXin> this command will allow vnc viewer to access vms from remote machine?
13:46:57 <alinefm> yes
13:47:25 <alinefm> because the vm console is running on localhost on host, so if you connect to host and then to vnc it works
13:48:37 <YuXin> so from my local machine to vnc the vm which is at a remote host still not work, right?
13:50:20 <alinefm> vncviewer <remote-ip>:<port> => does not work
13:50:39 <alinefm> as the port is only accessible for the host
13:51:04 <YuXin> why we block this access?
13:51:14 <alinefm> in this way vncviewer -via <remote host IP> localhost:<port> you will need to provide user/password to access the host server
13:51:36 <alinefm> to make sure only a user with host access can get the vm access
13:51:52 <alinefm> *get the vm console
13:53:38 <YuXin> so now, we have below protections against vm
13:53:45 <YuXin> 1. host user/pass
13:53:52 <YuXin> 2. vnc pass
13:54:01 <YuXin> 3. guest os user/pass
13:54:19 <alinefm> correct
13:54:29 <alinefm> the vnc pass is not fully implemented yet
13:54:34 <alinefm> but it is the plan
13:55:34 <YuXin> if as a user that most of my vms are not that important and I think guest os user/pass is enough
13:56:12 <YuXin> do you think we should give this type of user to get rid of 1 and 2
13:58:08 <alinefm> well, to login into kimchi, the user must have access to host
13:58:13 <alinefm> so 1. is not optional
13:59:28 <alinefm> about 2. we can add an option to disable it if the user want to
13:59:29 <YuXin> aline, difficult to get an answer through discussion
14:00:07 <YuXin> we need feedback from real enterprise users see their preference
14:00:14 <alinefm> but from 2. the default behavior should be protector IMO
14:00:36 <alinefm> YuXin, agree!
14:00:42 <YuXin> ok
14:00:56 <alinefm> feedbacks are always welcome from enterprise or common users
14:02:05 <alinefm> we are over time
14:02:10 <alinefm> anything else for today?
14:03:05 <alinefm> ok
14:03:07 <alinefm> thanks all for joining
