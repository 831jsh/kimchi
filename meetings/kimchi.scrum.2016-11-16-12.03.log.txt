12:18:57 <lcorreia> no
12:19:11 <ramonn> nop
12:21:21 <danielhb> alinefm, I have one
12:21:24 <danielhb> alinefm, a question actually
12:21:28 <alinefm> danielhb, go ahead
12:21:55 <danielhb> alinefm, I am afraid to do some code repetition in the UI. I want to replicate the same 'processor' tab in the Template Edit window in the Edit Guest window
12:22:43 <danielhb> alinefm, I  tried to do it modular (put the html in a separated file, then load it inside template edit/guest edit) but no success. Is there a standard way to do this in WoK?
12:23:33 <alinefm> danielhb, afaik if it is on html it is duplicated
12:24:05 <alinefm> we only have separated files for dialogs and tabs
12:24:42 <danielhb> alinefm, so the question is: I want to replicate an UI element from one dialog to the other. Should I just copy/paste the content?
12:25:06 <alinefm> danielhb, if it is HTML, yes
12:25:11 <danielhb> alinefm, ok
12:25:24 <danielhb> alinefm, and what about the js files?
12:25:51 <danielhb> alinefm, there will be some code from kimchi.template_edit that would be copy/pasted to kimchi.guest_edit. Is that ok?
12:26:30 <alinefm> danielhb, no
12:26:50 <alinefm> danielhb, copy it to a common file and use it over where
12:27:03 <danielhb> alinefm, do we have a utils like class?
12:27:29 <danielhb> alinefm, just checked here. no, we have not
12:27:34 <alinefm> danielhb, I don't think so. You should create a function kimchi.buildProcessor() and use it when needed
12:27:57 <danielhb> alinefm, and where can I host this function? create a new file?
12:28:11 <alinefm> danielhb, you can create it on top of template_edit or guest_edit
12:28:31 <alinefm> as all the JS are compiled into one kimchi.min.js there will be no difference
12:28:38 <danielhb> alinefm, and, since kimchi aggregates everything in a single JS, it will be visible to everyone
12:28:45 <alinefm> yeap
12:28:55 <danielhb> alinefm, alright ma'am, thanks for clarifying
12:29:22 <alinefm> yw
12:29:29 <alinefm> anything else?
12:30:07 <danielhb> alinefm, I have nothing else
12:32:57 <alinefm> so thanks everyone for joining
