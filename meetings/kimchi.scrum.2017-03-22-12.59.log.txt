13:15:13 <alinefm> #topic Open Discussion
13:15:24 <alinefm> I only have one topic for today related to this meeting
13:15:53 <alinefm> I don't think it is useful anymore as most of this discussion is done on ML.
13:16:31 <alinefm> so it will be our last scrum meeting. Feel free to ping this channel when needed otherwise, the ML is also a good way for communication
13:16:57 <alinefm> any opposition on that?
13:18:03 <danielhb> no
13:20:06 <ramonn> no
13:20:51 <alinefm> great!
13:20:55 <alinefm> thanks everyone for joining!
