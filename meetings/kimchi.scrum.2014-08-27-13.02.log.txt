13:09:32 <alinefm> those feature are: pci passthrough, async event notification, migration
13:09:33 <baude> #info almost complete on patches to edit graphics options on the template and guests
13:09:52 <baude> #info baude almost complete on patches to edit graphics options on the template and guests
13:09:57 <YuXin> what is the status of pci passthrough backend?
13:10:22 <alinefm> the last time I talked to zheng zhou he was finishing the tests in some distros
13:10:31 <alinefm> but I don't have a status of those tests
13:10:40 <alinefm> he is out for the linuxcon conf this week
13:10:43 <wenwang> What about the status of Asynchronous event notify in the back-end
13:11:06 <alinefm> wenwang, no status on it =/
13:11:10 <alinefm> the same for migration
13:12:45 <YuXin> ok, let us focus on all those that can be delivered
13:12:59 <YuXin> I will get iscsi target patch v2 out tomorrow
13:13:08 <alinefm> ok - thanks
13:13:32 <alinefm> I think the pci passthrough can be merged for 1.3 as the UI is done and backend is on way
13:14:12 <YuXin> ok, let us target for that
13:14:25 <alinefm> #topic Open Discussion
13:14:31 <alinefm> what are the topics for today?
13:15:44 <alinefm> nothing??! oO
13:16:27 <royce> Guys are struggling with their problems:)
13:17:00 <alinefm> lol
13:17:20 <alinefm> royce, glad to see the upload API worked
13:17:55 <alinefm> not sure you understood my comment on ML but I am OK to upload the file at once, but even though we need to return a Task on create()
13:18:39 <royce> yes, I am changing it to return a task
13:18:55 <wenwang> alinefm: Since we don't have any status of the Asynchronous event notify, could someone else have this task done or is anybody interested in doing the back-end work
13:19:33 <alinefm> wenwang, yeap! I plan to take this one once I finished the federation task and graphics refactor
13:20:02 <alinefm> wenwang, I need to careful read your RFC and check for backend techniques
13:20:05 <wenwang> alinefm: That's great
13:20:06 <rotru> alinefm;  I need someone to take my task over
13:20:53 <wenwang> alinefm: Yeah, we do have lots of options, and also I will read those docs and we can discuss on those details with you
13:21:00 <rotru> alinefm;  I can send a new version today, but need someone to make review changes
13:21:55 <alinefm> royce, are you too overload or you can take the rotru's task (during his vacation)?
13:22:04 <alinefm> otherwise, I will clone myself for it lol
13:22:53 <royce> I will be on vacation during 5th Sep- 8th
13:23:04 <royce> if I can finish mine
13:23:09 <royce> I will take it
13:24:28 <rotru> alinefm; royce  :D
13:25:25 <alinefm> royce, ok - thanks
13:25:37 <alinefm> any other topic?

13:29:09 <alinefm> and focus in our 1.3 tasks =P
13:29:13 <alinefm> baude, go ahead
13:29:39 <baude> im curious when kimchi can move to a version/release cycle as well
13:29:54 <baude> which will make it easier for distros to package/update and so forth
13:30:17 <alinefm> baude, we have one release every 3 months
13:30:33 <baude> a tarball release?
13:30:44 <alinefm> basically, end of March, end of June, end of Sept and end of December
13:30:53 <alinefm> yes
13:30:57 <baude> ok cool
13:30:59 <baude> i missed that
13:31:04 <baude> nm then :)
13:31:10 <alinefm> kimchi 1.3 will be 09/26
13:31:22 <alinefm> and then we start planning the next one for the end of December
13:31:28 <baude> great
13:31:31 <baude> we can wrap up now
13:32:00 <alinefm> baude, any news from fedora? about including kimchi?
