13:03:07 <alinefm> anything else?
13:05:37 <alinefm> ok.. so let's get started
13:05:49 <alinefm> #topic Status
13:05:49 <alinefm> #info Please provide your status using the #info command: #info <nickname> <status>
13:06:44 <ziviani> #info ziviani Sent a V3 of a patch ([PATCH V3] Number of CPUs and Physical Memory)
13:06:45 <ziviani> #info ziviani Sent a RFC about serial console tool in Kimchi.
13:06:45 <ziviani> #info ziviani I'm currently testing PCI hotplug in X86_64 and PPC64.
13:06:47 <vianac> #info vianac sent RFC for hotplug a new disk, hotplug a network interface, add suspend/resume, change ref_cnt; sent another revision of fix for #461;
13:06:47 <alinefm> #info alinefm worked for 1.4.1 release: update package, changelog, github main page, etc
13:07:11 <alinefm> #info alinefm sent RFC to make template defaults configurable
13:07:45 <royce> #info royce invested about using puppet to setup kimchi, tested the UI bugs on ipad, started writing patch for logical pool for existed VG
13:09:07 <alinefm> royce, could you send a RFC about creating a storage pool from an existing VG?
13:09:19 <alinefm> so we can get agreement on API before you start working
13:09:26 <alinefm> just to make it easier
13:09:58 <royce> I thought it is a small feature, so planned to send the patch with API spec...
13:11:11 <royce> I will send it tomorrow
13:11:31 <alinefm> royce, thanks
13:11:42 <alinefm> anything else?
13:12:56 <alinefm> #topic Kimchi 1.5 Plan
13:13:06 <alinefm> I have created the schedule in the github wiki: https://github.com/kimchi-project/kimchi/wiki/planning-1.5
13:13:14 <alinefm> please check the dates in the link
13:13:51 <alinefm> I will create the todo page later today after reading all the RFC on ML and check the open issues
13:14:04 <alinefm> any questions? doubts? suggestion?
13:16:00 <alinefm> vianac, royce, ziviani, danielhb, ^
13:16:12 <vianac> alinefm, no
13:16:21 <danielhb> alinefm, I have none
13:17:00 <alinefm> #topic Open Discussion
13:17:07 <alinefm> what do you want to discuss today?
13:19:34 <alinefm> vianac, any update about the needinfo issues?
13:20:29 <vianac> alinefm, no, any new issue with that status
13:21:20 <alinefm> ok
13:21:51 <alinefm> vianac, royce, danielhb, ziviani, if you don't have anything else we can finish the meeting for today
13:22:12 <danielhb> alinefm, did you had the time to look at that github issue I talked about yesterday?
13:22:22 <royce> I sent a RFC about using puppet to set up kimchi environment, because I find every release it is painful for me to set up a complete test env
13:23:36 <danielhb> alinefm, I believe that Kimchi shouldn't bother resolving host name to IP if qemu can't handle hostnames. It creates a whole new different issue on Kimchi side. I'd rather ask people to download the ISO or update their qemu than to rely on the randomness we have today with the remote streaming
13:25:14 <alinefm> danielhb, just read it
13:25:34 <alinefm> danielhb, removing it now we cause a regression for fedora users
13:25:49 <danielhb> alinefm, it works in F21
13:26:15 <alinefm> danielhb, qemu can resolve hostnames on F21?
13:26:35 <danielhb> alinefm, vianac said that he can't reproduce the issue in his F21. vianac ?
13:27:01 <alinefm> danielhb, are you on f21?
13:27:35 <lagarcia> alinefm, danielhb does it work in RHEL 6.x? or is this feature not available in older distros?
13:27:38 <danielhb> alinefm, and even if F21 is bugged, I don't consider it a regression because now Kimchi has the option to download the ISO. And, again, unless Kimchi can guarantee that the remote server will resolve the URL correctly, the feature is flawed
13:28:45 <alinefm> lagarcia, RHEL 6.X does not have support for iso streaming on qemu
13:28:54 <lagarcia> alinefm, ok
13:29:44 <alinefm> danielhb, I agree but I suggest to find a way to improve the hostname-IP resolution Kimchi is doing before removing this
13:30:25 <alinefm> danielhb, for example, I have tested long time ago, the resolution failed in the original URL redirects to other one
13:30:47 <alinefm> I think we first need to get the final URL and then resolve the hostname
13:31:00 <alinefm> so it may work in all cases
13:31:12 <alinefm> *but* we need to test and investigate it is a good solution
13:32:12 <danielhb> alinefm, I believe it will fail the same way as it does now. If you insert an URL like http://n.n.n.n:80/my_link there is no guarantee that the webserver will redirect you to http://nameserver.com/my_link
13:32:36 <danielhb> alinefm, we can't control how the remote server resolves the incoming URL
13:33:06 <danielhb> alinefm, but I do not oppose testing other ways before ditching this design
13:33:53 <danielhb> brb
13:34:48 <alinefm> danielhb, we need also to confirm all the current qemu versions still have this issues on resolving hostnames
13:34:58 <alinefm> otherwise we can remove it IMO
13:36:21 <alinefm> royce, about the complete test env, vianac is using a script to do that on his vms
13:37:59 <vianac> danielhb, alinefm: on Fedora 21, that issue doesn't exist because its qemu-io version can handle DNS names, so we don't need to convert anything
13:40:45 <alinefm> I will test it on RHEL7, opensuse and ubuntu
13:41:01 <alinefm> probably the qemu versions there is also working now
13:41:08 <alinefm> any other topic for today?
13:42:00 <royce> I tried to write script too, but found set up like iscsi server and ldap needs some intervention. So I planned to switch to puppet
13:43:02 <alinefm> oh.. vianac's script is simpler than that
13:43:16 <alinefm> it is just to run "make check" inside the vm
13:43:49 <royce> Oh, it's like jenkins, right?
13:44:27 <royce> I just meant to make user easier to set up a sand box to play with kimchi's all features
13:45:01 <alinefm> got it
13:48:41 <alinefm> any other topic?
13:49:33 <ziviani> no
13:51:53 <alinefm> thanks everyone for joining!
