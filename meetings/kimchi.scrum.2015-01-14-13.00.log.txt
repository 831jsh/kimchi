13:07:33 <alinefm> wenwang, YuXin, do you know when we will start seeing the new UI?
13:07:54 <YuXin> we will first get all base widgets completed
13:08:29 <YuXin> for me, I will going to work on chart and tab widget which at least takes 2 weeks
13:08:44 <YuXin> and wen has a series widgets to work on
13:09:04 <YuXin> once these widgets got completed, then we will start to work on new header
13:09:13 <alinefm> alright - so only in Feb we will have them done to start working on UI redesign
13:09:39 <YuXin> then update kimchi tabs one by one using those widgets specially created for kimchi
13:09:48 <alinefm> ok
13:09:54 <alinefm> YuXin, wenwang, I am only concerned about the time as we need to have it done by end of March
13:10:20 <wenwang> alinefm: we will do our best
13:10:38 <YuXin> I think it is ok, as once based widget is completed, it will save a lot of work by reuse
13:10:39 <alinefm> let me know if you need help or something
13:10:55 <wenwang> sure. thx alinefm
13:11:23 <YuXin> alinefm, when merging UI patch, if you see any issue that you can add to get it resolved, just feel free to do it
13:11:26 <YuXin> that will save time
13:11:55 <alinefm> YuXin, thanks!
13:12:24 <alinefm> I always like to ask for confirmation as some people may don't like it =)
13:12:39 <YuXin> I never mind
13:12:51 <alinefm> good to know
13:13:01 <alinefm> let's move on
13:13:06 <alinefm> #topic Open Discussion
13:13:13 <alinefm> what are the topics for today?
13:13:51 <YuXin> we need a open source javascript charting library, then we can wrap it into jquery widget, anyone has any idea, please send it to mail list
13:14:35 <alinefm> is it  for the new host stats widget?
13:14:40 <YuXin> yes
13:15:14 <alinefm> I will do some investigation on it
13:15:24 <YuXin> thanks
13:15:33 <alinefm> but can't we reuse the chart we are using now and only change the style?
13:16:27 <YuXin> but if we got charting library, that will be strategic
13:16:50 <alinefm> yes
13:16:54 <YuXin> I have ever used dojo, it has a charting libary of line/colume/bar/pie widgets
13:17:18 <YuXin> it has quite complete functionality and quite strong customization capability
13:17:51 <YuXin> usually, we did not develop these mature things by ourselves, but re-use a good one
13:17:57 <alinefm> sure
13:18:03 <alinefm> let's try to find something
13:18:14 <alinefm> and we also need to care about the license
13:18:38 <alinefm> any other topic?
13:18:38 <YuXin> http://demos.dojotoolkit.org/demos/
13:20:09 <alinefm> very nice
13:20:54 <alinefm> ok - I have one point
13:21:56 <alinefm> maybe all of you've already seen some discussion on ML to replace nginx to a lightweight proxy
13:22:05 <alinefm> as nginx has a lot of dependencies and so
13:22:22 <alinefm> so I thought about lighttpd
13:22:40 <alinefm> any other suggestion?
13:23:18 <alinefm> vianac, royce, ramonn, danielhb, ^
13:23:45 <royce> I didn't use any other ones than apache, django, cherrypy, but I can do some research
13:24:43 <alinefm> royce, ramonn is working on that
13:24:55 <royce> cool
13:25:05 <alinefm> his first attempt was using lighttpd which works fine
13:26:24 <alinefm> but seems no opposition to replace nginx =)
13:26:32 <alinefm> any other topic for today?
13:29:33 <alinefm> alright...
13:29:41 <alinefm> so thanks everyone for joining!
