13:16:09 <alinefm> #topic Open Discussion
13:16:12 <pvital> alinefm, thanks! :-)
13:16:25 <alinefm> First of all, I want to thank you all for the great job to have 2,2 releases done!
13:16:30 <alinefm> keep it up! =)
13:16:50 <alinefm> I could not think about the next release yet but I will do that and share anything in the ML
13:17:04 <alinefm> the next release will be on last Friday of September (as always)
13:17:10 <alinefm> any question?
13:17:18 <chandra> Congratulations to all !!!
13:17:53 <pvital> no questions! just want to say that if you need any help, ask us ;-)
13:18:10 <chandra> alinefm, ticket https://github.com/kimchi-project/wok/issues/134
13:18:16 <alinefm> pvital, sure!
13:18:27 <alinefm> any input/suggestion for the next release is more then welcome
13:18:43 <alinefm> you can propose new features, enhancements...
13:18:50 <alinefm> all them will take place if you want
13:19:13 <alinefm> chandra, danielhb_ has commented about that issue to me
13:19:25 <alinefm> i don't see it as an issue as we enforce the connection via https
13:20:16 <chandra> alinefm, right now there is way user may try http as well
13:20:29 <alinefm> chandra, how?
13:20:40 <alinefm> all http requests are redirected to https
13:21:34 <chandra> so even user set https_only = false, all the requests redirected via https ?
13:21:41 <alinefm> yeap
13:22:00 <chandra> oh is it, in that case we are safe I guess
13:22:03 <alinefm> chandra, when you do any request to HTTP (port 8000) it will be redirected to HTTPS (8001)
13:22:21 <alinefm> chandra, yeap! I don't see issues on it since all the requests are done on HTTPS
13:22:59 <chandra> ok good.
13:23:20 <alinefm> any other topic for today?
13:23:56 <chandra> Also any idea on password encryption via java script ?
13:23:57 <pvital> no
13:24:36 <chandra> which is translated system password encryption standards ?
13:25:32 <alinefm> chandra, I don't know about it
13:25:42 <alinefm> maybe peterpennings or samhenri have more inputs on it to share
13:25:49 <alinefm> chandra, but how would be good for us?
13:26:49 <chandra> there is one loop hole I could think of even if the password is transferred to the server and during the password processing on the server side
13:27:09 <chandra> in the python code by transferring the password as it is...
13:27:29 <peterpennings> I donÂ´t think is a good idea to do it trought javascript.
13:27:36 <samhenri> agreed
13:28:11 <peterpennings> javascript runs on client side, it's not security
13:28:26 <chandra> there is a possibility of debugs/log some admin with privileges can get to know others credentials ..
13:29:02 <chandra> But is javascript is handling the password data then I feel it should take care such encryptions too...
13:29:31 <alinefm> chandra, any admin with root access to the host system can do anything he/she wants
13:29:34 <chandra> there are some developments in this area, for example cryptjs is one who does this...
13:29:39 <alinefm> including adding a script to get the others password
13:30:26 <chandra> nodejs does the password encryption techniques ...
13:30:59 <alinefm> chandra, but how would that help us on security?
13:31:16 <alinefm> we will need to decrypt it on server side
13:31:31 <peterpennings> you mean change everything to nodejs?
13:31:51 <chandra> alinefm, they encrypt the password on the client side and on the server side you do not require to decrypt if it generates data which system tools can understand it ...
13:32:34 <chandra> peterpennings, I am not suggesting to change to nodejs but as an example I am referring nodejs does the encryption...
13:33:10 <peterpennings> yes.. but it is a big change, nodejs runs on server side..
13:33:23 <chandra> alinefm, you can simply pass same encrypted string to let us say libuser python binding, it understand how to save on to the system.
13:34:04 <alinefm> to save to the system?
13:34:06 <chandra> peterpennings, in any means I am not suggesting us to shift to nodejs
13:34:06 <danielhb_> chandra, I am not sure what are the problem you're trying to address
13:34:08 <alinefm> we don't save passwords
13:34:42 <chandra> well ginger module does this for the user creation ... ie applies to password file ...
13:36:01 <alinefm> chandra, I don't know how the user management works on ginger
13:36:04 <chandra> danielhb, I am trying to find a way which would help password encryption and server side use the same as it is ... by this you never deal with raw password string
13:36:18 <alinefm> danielhb_, do we save the password somewhere?
13:36:27 <samhenri> i think for the user management feature it may be good to add some sort of encryption but retaining the encryption key in the server side
13:36:30 <alinefm> when managing users
13:36:58 <chandra> alinefm, user creation we take the password input and provides this to libuser python binding if I am correct ...
13:37:24 <chandra> like how the adduser passes all the input for user creation ...
13:37:53 <danielhb> chandra, yeah but this is inside a SSL session in HTTPS
13:38:00 <danielhb> chandra, it is secure already
13:38:55 <danielhb> chandra, we can cypher the password in client side? yeah. but the cypher logic will be embedded in the client code, which is not secure and can be easily tampered with. The extra logic will not provide that much security
13:39:34 <chandra> Did some experiments similar on google gmail account etc...
13:40:27 <chandra> since they are too web applications, even on the client side it is almost impossible to figure out what the password is...
13:40:46 <chandra> or the other banking applications...
13:41:36 <danielhb> chandra, define 'client side'
13:41:49 <chandra> I am trying to understand why we can not provide similar security both sides if possible... I am may be little bit wage here but I feel there is some possibility for us to increase the security ..
13:42:18 <chandra> danielhb, 'client side' I mean browser ..
13:42:20 <danielhb> chandra, because no web application is secure if I load the page, open firebug and change <input='password'> to <input='text'>
13:43:09 <chandra> danielhb, did any body tried same on the gmail log in page and see if possible to such things ?
13:43:30 <chandra> *do
13:44:19 <danielhb> chandra, just did hahaha
13:44:32 <chandra> is it :-)
13:44:48 <danielhb> chandra, how can I share a screenshot? let me see how here ....
13:46:16 <danielhb> chandra,  just a sec! uploading it here ...
13:46:46 <chandra> danielhb, try not to share your password ;-)
13:47:58 <danielhb> chandra, http://picpaste.com/Screenshot_from_2016-06-29_10-44-10-P9rQAndu.png
13:48:40 <chandra> danielhb, I saw that too  ...
13:50:06 <danielhb> chandra, anyway, as a I said in the bug, there are stuff we can do to enhance, but we can't fully prevent this type of scenario
13:50:59 <chandra> danielhb, hmm. I request UI developers to look through the defect and propose if you have some thing to help !!!
13:51:10 <chandra> daneilhb, thanks !!!
13:53:02 <chandra> danielhb, samhenri, any update on the side pane development for ginger ?
13:54:15 <samhenri> I will collect some links regarding this later and send to the ML but I think encrypting all password inputs will be very frustrating due how different browsers handle this so I'll look for evidence first
13:54:43 <samhenri> I've stopped working on Ginger sidebar to develop the redesigned panels for Ginger
13:55:57 <samhenri> we have a list of priorities that alinefm sent to us and the Network, Storage, Filesystem and San Adapters panels comes first
13:56:17 <samhenri> btw, we have some blocking issues that we need some confirmation asap
13:56:43 <alinefm> samhenri, do you want to share that now?
13:56:49 <samhenri> yes
13:56:55 <samhenri> it is very quick
13:57:05 <chandra> samhenri, sure, to update all, atreyee, rajat and mani are working storage and network panels too...
13:57:39 <chandra> so I would recommend to work with them through github issues if you have any proposals in those areas ...
13:57:41 <alinefm> chandra, on what are they working on?
13:57:54 <samhenri> but are they improving the current Bootgrid Tables or working on the API?
13:58:02 <alinefm> samhenri, is working on those redesign issues I opened some time ago
13:58:39 <samhenri> yes, I've got ok from alinefm and danielhb to port jQuery Bootgrid to DataTables.net
13:58:43 <chandra> alinefm, they are working on the API's at the same time addressing some of the concerns proposed by aline as per github discussions
13:59:18 <samhenri> In fact a patch for Wok was sent already but the mailserver corrupted the minified JS files and I'll sent another one
13:59:54 <samhenri> Ok, so I guess we'll have to wait them finish these enhancements before porting to DataTables
13:59:56 <chandra> well not fully sure how this will impact on the overall work
14:00:00 <alinefm> chandra, I'd suggest to get them concentrated on fixing the bakend (API) and then align the UI with samhenri and peterpennings
14:00:43 <samhenri> yes, this would be great
14:00:48 <chandra> alinefm, I would recommend to hold samhenri and peterpennings until atreyee, rajat and mani completes their work
14:01:20 <alinefm> chandra, why?
14:01:27 <chandra> alinefm, so questions is are we going to use datatables all over the pages irrespective of the plugins ?
14:01:33 <alinefm> they should work on API and samhenri on UI side
14:01:44 <alinefm> chandra, no no
14:01:52 <alinefm> chandra, we will introduce the library to wok
14:02:00 <alinefm> and any plugin can use it when needed
14:02:14 <chandra> alinefm, atreyee, rajat and mani are working on the UI panels of both network and storage ...
14:02:16 <alinefm> chandra, during the redesign samhenri will use it, but the other code using bootgrid will continue to work
14:02:39 <samhenri> yes, we are even proposing to use DataTables on Kimchi as well
14:02:39 <chandra> not on the backend API. they are adding additional support to the UI with actions
14:02:51 <samhenri> to make wok.datagrid only for Guests, Templates and Storage Volumes
14:04:17 <chandra> I would recommend to wait till July before we port storage and network to datatables ..
14:04:38 <chandra> because these pages are getting added with more ui functionality ...
14:05:59 <chandra> alinefm, samhenri as long as we agree on the overall operation (like multiselections), I am all up for it.. and we should not put duplicate efforts
14:06:10 <samhenri> well, IMO we can wait until these new functionalities are added
14:06:49 <chandra> samhenri, I agree with you ...
14:07:07 <samhenri> this way we can work on other issues like Ginger sidebar, Kimchi Peers dropdown and other minor issues/enhancements
14:07:28 <samhenri> BTW, I also have a question regarding Kimchi Peers
14:07:45 <samhenri> Is it going to Ginger, Gingerbase or Wok?
14:08:24 <samhenri> Issue #921 FYI
14:10:30 <alinefm> samhenri, not sure right now
14:10:40 <alinefm> I was supposed to send a email to the ML but I forgot =s
14:11:24 <alinefm> samhenri, chandra about the redesign issues, I suggest to start working on those not impacted by the API changes
14:11:32 <alinefm> so we can better use our time
14:13:25 <alinefm> we are over time!
14:13:31 <samhenri> ok
14:13:35 <chandra> ok
14:13:36 <alinefm> I will end the meeting but we can continue discussing here
14:13:52 <alinefm> thanks everyone for joining and for the great discussions!
