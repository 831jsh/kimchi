13:13:47 <alinefm> #topic Open Discussion
13:14:07 <pvital> I have one
13:14:08 <alinefm> I only have a reminder, we are one week to the 2.2. releases
13:14:23 <alinefm> pvital, go ahead
13:16:25 <pvital> as requested by alinefm, I'm going to create distros (Fedora 23, Ubuntu 16.04, OpenSuse bla) with wok, kimchi and ginger* 2.2 installed and configured to make available to download by users
13:17:04 <pvital> so, as soon 2.2 is released, I'll create the images and upload to some place
13:17:10 <alinefm> \o/
13:17:16 <alinefm> I am looking forward to it
13:17:21 <pvital> the problem is this. where should this images be located?
13:17:31 <pvital> these
13:17:31 <alinefm> github.io pages?
13:17:55 <alinefm> I think we can load them there in a separated section than the RPM/DEB packages
13:18:30 <pvital> it's an option, but I'm concern about the size of the images
13:19:01 <alinefm> good point
13:19:35 <alinefm> maybe a ftp server would be better
13:20:21 <pvital> alinefm, don't ovirt.org host these images?
13:21:09 <alinefm> pvital, I am not sure, but we can check and get in contact with someone there to analyze the possibility
13:21:29 <pvital> nice
13:21:38 <alinefm> pvital, you can ping eedri from #ovirt channel to get more information about that
13:21:49 <pvital> ok
13:22:12 <alinefm> pvital, and let me know if you need my help on anything to get what you need
13:23:59 <alinefm> any other topic for today?
13:26:09 <alinefm> ok...
