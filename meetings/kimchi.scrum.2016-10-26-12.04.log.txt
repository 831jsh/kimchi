12:10:25 <alinefm> danielhb, have you included the instructions to update the pip packages somewhere?
12:10:44 <danielhb> alinefm, not yet, I'll send an email to both ML reporting these css findings
12:10:56 <alinefm> danielhb, great! thanks
12:10:58 <danielhb> alinefm, I forgot to send it yesterday

12:11:51 <alinefm> #topic Open Discussion
12:12:01 <alinefm> do you have any other topic for today?
12:13:55 <lcorreia> no
12:15:11 <ramonn> nop
12:15:53 <alinefm> I have one =)
12:16:07 <alinefm> ramonn, danielhb I have replied to the ML already but I want to talk more here too
12:16:13 <alinefm> about the filter on modules
12:16:44 <alinefm> there are 2 ways to do that, one using loaded (a resource parameter) and other one using _loaded (a get_list parameter)
12:16:58 <alinefm> maybe I was clear in the ML and you can understand the differences
12:19:14 <ramonn> alinefm, i got it
12:21:18 <danielhb> alinefm, ramonn my concern is that in the current code (calling modinfo() for each module), if we consider all existing kernel modules, the API will take too long to retrieve the results. But I believe aline's suggestion to make the backend behave differently according to the filter parameter is a fine solution.
12:22:44 <alinefm> seems everyone on the same page! good =)
12:22:56 <alinefm> I don't have anything else, so we can end it by now
12:23:04 <alinefm> thanks everyone for joining!
