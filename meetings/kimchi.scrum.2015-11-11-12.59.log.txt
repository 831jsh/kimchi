13:06:01 <pvital> alinefm, yeap but this is my log since the last scrum meeting :-P
13:06:04 <danielhb> #info danielhb sent a version of the non shared storage live migration  for review
13:06:10 <alinefm> pvital, hehehe
13:06:28 <samhenri> #info samhenri currently working on edit guests modal windows
13:07:08 <andreteodoro> #info andreteodoro working on Guests screen new ui
13:08:57 <alinefm> pvital, to attach a new volume to the VM, I don't think we need to craete a new API. Couldn't we use POST /storagepools/<pool>/storagevolumes {capacity: ..} + POST /vms/<name>/storages {...}
13:09:26 <alinefm> atreyee, as Samuel patches have already been merged upstream, maybe you can rebase on master now
13:09:59 <atreyee> alinefm, sure
13:10:05 <alinefm> samhenri, do you plan to continue maintaining your repository from now on? or will you discontinued it as your patches were applied upstream?
13:10:24 <alinefm> rotru, anything else to share?
13:10:30 <samhenri> until guests screen is not finished i will use my fork
13:10:47 <samhenri> once guests and edit guests are applied I'll send patches to upstream
13:11:28 <samhenri> The same goes for Ginger
13:11:51 <alinefm> ok
13:12:10 <danielhb> samhenri, any ETA for the Ginger UI ?
13:13:00 <samhenri> I can send a patch now for the new-ui UI toolbar, I'm going to pick some Ginger panels after Edit Guests
13:13:12 <samhenri> new-ui toolbar and tab-ext.xml
13:13:31 <rotru> #info rotru Finished porting of Multiple Disks in Template edit window - Sent patch to upstream, need to rebase with new UI
13:13:36 <samhenri> after applying the new-ui some panels and buttons from ginger are not displaying correctly
13:13:47 <rotru> #info rotru Finished porting of Memory 256MiB alignment and slots <= 0 for PowerPC - Sent patchset to kimchi upstream;
13:14:11 <samhenri> and I also have to create a new widget for Batch Delete and Backup dialogs
13:14:32 <pvital> alinefm, them I'll add a new disk with the same size of the current disk. The idea is to let user decide the size of the new volume in the UI
13:15:04 <alinefm> samhenri, from the last scrum meeting you said the Administration tab would be done by Nov 13
13:15:10 <alinefm> samhenri, is the date still right?
13:15:33 <samhenri> correct, if I manage to finish Edit Guests today
13:15:42 <rotru> samhenri,  alinefm  have you tested the new UI in Firefox ?
13:15:42 <alinefm> ok
13:15:48 <alinefm> rotru, yes
13:16:16 <pvital> alinefm, as well the new volume format - user should select one inthe UI
13:16:19 <samhenri> rotru, i've been using Firefox developer edition
13:16:26 <WalterNik> sanhenri, what do you mean with:  I can send a patch now for the new-ui UI toolbar ?
13:16:37 <alinefm> pvital, sure! but it can be done by POST /storagepools/<pool>/storagevolumes {capacity: .. format:...}
13:16:49 <pvital> alinefm, and which capacity and volume should I take if my VM already have 10 volumes of different sizes?
13:16:55 <rotru> alinefm, samhenri  the template edit is not OK in firefox for me
13:17:33 <alinefm> pvital, sorry! not sure I followed you
13:17:48 <WalterNik> samhenri, asking because atreyee is working on the new UI-navigation right now
13:17:55 <rotru> alinefm, samhenri  the template edit  window (storages and interface
13:17:58 <rotru> )
13:18:05 <danielhb> rotru, have you tested the new UI in Firefox? how did it look?
13:18:37 <rotru> danielhb,  ?? thats what I am talking about
13:18:39 <samhenri> WalterNik, I mean apply the red toolbar for Ginger
13:18:41 <alinefm> seems it is time to move on to open discussion hehe
13:18:43 <WalterNik> sanhenri, and I guess that would affect the tab-ext.xml as well :-)
13:18:48 <alinefm> #topic Open Discussion
13:19:04 <danielhb> rotru, in your opinion the UI needs fixes when running in Firefox. Is that it?
13:19:38 <alinefm> pvital, POST /storagepools/<pool>/storagevolumes {capacity: .. format:...} create a volume with a given size and format
13:19:44 <alinefm> pvital, agree?
13:19:49 <rotru> danielhb,  yeap ...   I did not open all windows yet ... I am just warning about Template Edit
13:19:55 <alinefm> pvital, user can select any size and any format
13:19:58 <danielhb> rotru, got it
13:20:21 <alinefm> pvital, after having the volume created we can attach it to the vm by using the existing API POST /vms/<name>/storages/
13:20:45 <pvital> alinefm, yeah but I guess what you are suggesting is: 1st add a volume in the pool; and then, 2) attach the volume in the VM
13:21:15 <pvital> the idea is create the volume in the pool, at the same time of attaching it to the VM
13:21:44 <alinefm> pvital, from a user point of view, yeap!
13:21:49 <pvital> the backend process is what you suggest. 1st i create the volume then I attach it
13:22:01 <alinefm> pvital, but the background task would be splitted into 2
13:22:20 <alinefm> rotru, jus testes here and I don't see issues with the edit template dialog
13:22:38 <alinefm> rotru, I mean, there are some elements not fully aligned but the dialog is useful
13:22:47 <pvital> alinefm, it is!!! first I create the volume, then I attach it to the VM
13:23:17 <rotru> alinefm,  yeap... thats my point
13:23:24 <pvital> but I need to that using only one REST command
13:23:36 <alinefm> rotru, don't have elements aligned means it is broken on firefox?
13:23:59 <alinefm> pvital, my point is: do we need a new API to do that? Or let the UI do the 2 API calls?
13:24:04 <rotru> alinefm,  yes
13:24:23 <rotru> alinefm, but not a big issue
13:24:38 <rotru> :)
13:24:46 <samhenri> rotru, just confirmed that the fields are not aligned on master, I think I forgot one commit that fixed that :\
13:25:02 <alinefm> rotru, whew!
13:25:16 <alinefm> rotru, "by not working" I thought in something really broken
13:25:17 <alinefm> heheh
13:25:27 <alinefm> samhenri, you can send the patch separated to the ML
13:25:37 <samhenri> yes, I going to do this asap
13:25:42 <WalterNik> samhenri, I guess that red coloring on Admin tab is not up to date anymore ... pls check issue # 746 (new navigation bar ) atreyee is almost finished on the new navigation:  Virtualization (green) and Host (blue) Tab as first lvl and the active 2nd lvl tab will simply get a darker color shade
13:26:13 <pvital> alinefm, I don't like the UI, so I think that API must be changed to address the same usability by the REST commands
13:26:26 <rotru> samhenri, alinefm  I understand what happened ... I had open in Firefox and I think it used some old CSS, so, first time, it was a mess .... when I opened in Firefox private window, I just saw the alignment problem ...
13:26:36 <WalterNik> samhenri, atreyee was working on top of your repo so the changes should fit
13:26:51 <alinefm> pvital, don't you like to do UI code? or... ?
13:27:11 <pvital> LOL
13:27:17 <samhenri> WalterNik, yes, I know. I've applied the patch Chandra sent on e-mail locally
13:27:19 <danielhb> alinefm, LOL pvital likes to code javascript in his free time!
13:27:37 <pvital> alinefm, that was sarcasm!! just trying to convince you!
13:27:49 <alinefm> pvital, I am not telling/asking you to do the UI part of code
13:27:51 <WalterNik> samhenri, but atreyee is facing a problem: she doesn't get her source css being compiled ... can you help with a hint ?
13:27:57 <samhenri> WalterNik, but I also created a fork for Ginger
13:28:01 <rotru> alinefm,  "not working"  ... I overreacted ... sorry (hate cache)
13:28:02 <alinefm> pvital, just to confirm the existing APIs we have are enought to this feature
13:28:02 <samhenri> WalterNik, sure
13:28:13 <alinefm> pvital, if so, I will ask Socorro to do the UI code
13:29:08 <pvital> alinefm, that's the point!!!! I just thought to provide a way to attach a new disk once - by the UI or REST commands!
13:29:18 <rotru> alinefm, danielhb , samhenri  have not observed issues in Chrome
13:29:33 <alinefm> rotru, great! thanks for the feedbacks
13:30:32 <atreyee> samhenri, I added a new variable in _wok_variable.scss , but after compilation I find that it's not available in css file
13:30:43 <alinefm> pvital, it is arguably! as having 2 ways to do the same thing may require more maintenance
13:30:51 <atreyee> i mean it's value did not reflected
13:30:54 <alinefm> but I am open to hear all opinions on that =)
13:32:04 <atreyee> it's happening for me in all scss changes.
13:32:11 <samhenri> atreyee are you running sassc command directly on css/src folder?
13:32:26 <atreyee> no.
13:32:49 <atreyee> samhenri, Do I need to?
13:33:08 <atreyee> I am just using make command
13:33:27 <jansch> samhenri, can we integrate this into the make?
13:33:38 <samhenri> atreyee just to get the full output error
13:34:04 <samhenri> jansch it is already there
13:34:12 <samhenri> I've updated gingerbase makefile
13:34:20 <jansch> thx
13:34:25 <atreyee> samhenri, I did not see any error in log
13:35:42 <samhenri> have you changed _wok-variables in kimchi/ui/css/src/modules or somewhere else?
13:36:00 <samhenri> because gingerbase.scss is pointing to this location location
13:36:16 <samhenri> i mean, getting wok-variables from kimchi/ui/css/
13:36:46 <atreyee> in _wok-variables in kimchi/ui/css/src/module
13:39:29 <samhenri> try running  sassc src/gingerbase.scss gingerbase.css
13:39:41 <samhenri> if there's an error the output should be something like this:
13:39:51 <samhenri> sassc: error: Error: top-level @import directive must be terminated by ';'
13:39:53 <samhenri> on line 29 of src/gingerbase.scss
13:39:54 <samhenri> >> @import "modules/host"
13:39:56 <samhenri> ----------------------^
13:40:22 <samhenri> this appears on the makefiles as well but sometimes it compiles the other makefiles too fast and you won't spot the error message
13:40:54 <samhenri> if the variable is really missing, then should be something like this: sassc: error: Error: Undefined variable: "$test-variable".
13:41:22 <atreyee> ok, I will try that
13:41:55 <atreyee> samhenri, thank you
13:42:11 <samhenri> I'll see if creating a symlink to kimchi/ui/css/src/modules works with sassc
13:42:31 <samhenri> atreyee yw
13:43:30 <alinefm> anything else, team?
13:43:41 <rotru> nope
13:44:33 <lcorreia> no
13:44:47 <danielhb> no
13:44:50 <WalterNik> no
13:44:58 <jansch> no
13:45:40 <alinefm> just a reminder: we have only 2 weeks for the code freeze
13:45:51 <alinefm> so all the features must be upstream prior to Nov 25
13:46:03 <alinefm> thanks everyone for joining!
