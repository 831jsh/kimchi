13:24:21 <alinefm> vianac, thanks!
13:24:31 <alinefm> alanoe contacted me as he wants to do the netboot feature for Kimchi
13:24:44 <alinefm> wenwang, did paulo send to you his patches on this feature?
13:24:54 <alinefm> I remember you were working on UI, right?
13:25:03 <wenwang> I am afraid I haven't got it
13:25:23 <wenwang> alinefm: What's it about?
13:25:38 <alanoe> support distro installation via netboot in a KVM guest
13:26:12 <alinefm> wenwang, let me find the bug on github
13:26:14 <alinefm> one minute
13:26:20 <alanoe> https://github.com/kimchi-project/kimchi/issues/372
13:26:22 <alanoe> alinefm ^
13:26:33 <wenwang> alinefm: That would be great
13:26:35 <alinefm> alanoe, thanks
13:26:39 <alanoe> yw
13:26:40 <wenwang> thanks alinefm
13:27:54 <alinefm> wenwang, you have sent a mockup for it some time ago: http://lists.ovirt.org/pipermail/kimchi-devel/2014-August/006879.html
13:28:15 <alinefm> but I am wondering about the backend patches
13:28:26 <alinefm> if you got them from paulo or not
13:30:32 <wenwang> alinefm: I remembered that. And I have his code which could probably need some minor change since it's a long time ago. Sorry that drop out of my working list
13:30:53 <alinefm> wenwang, don't worry about it
13:31:02 <wenwang> alinefm: I will find it out tomorrow and work on that
13:31:08 <alinefm> I mean, I only want to share the backend patches with alanoe
13:31:21 <alinefm> wenwang, on UI, you dont need to do anything
13:31:52 <wenwang> alinefm: ok. Do you need the original Paulo's patch?
13:31:58 <alinefm> wenwang, yeap
13:32:00 <alinefm> do you have them?
13:32:18 <wenwang> alinefm: I think I have it
13:32:35 <wenwang> alinefm: Will sent it to you tomorrow
13:32:46 <alinefm> if you find it, please send to ML as WIP so alanoe can get it and continue the work
13:32:51 <alinefm> wenwang, thanks
13:33:14 <alanoe> alinefm: maybe it is valid to rebase it based on master/next (dont know kimchi branching model) before sending to mailing list?
13:33:33 <wenwang> alinefm: No problem.
13:33:39 <alinefm> alanoe, I can do the rebase for you
13:33:40 <alanoe> should be quick if there werent major changes
13:33:43 <alanoe> alinefm: ty
13:34:12 <alinefm> wenwang, and again, you don't need to do anything about the UI for it
13:34:22 <alinefm> now we will focus on bug fixes and tests for 1.4 release
13:35:34 <wenwang> alinefm: Okay
13:37:08 <alinefm> any other topic?
13:37:24 <alanoe> alinefm: question: how can I test kimchi backend? automated tests, manual calls to REST API?
13:37:57 <alinefm> alanoe, we have some unit tests, you can check them under /tests
13:38:05 <alanoe> alinefm: ok, thanks
13:38:05 <alinefm> and run using "make check"
13:38:32 <alanoe> I'll start working on this as soon as I get paulo's patch
13:38:35 <alanoe> I have nothing else
13:38:40 <alinefm> great!
13:38:51 <alinefm> any problem you can ping us here or send a note to ML
13:38:57 <alanoe> sure
13:39:12 <alinefm> anything else, team?
13:41:17 <alinefm> well, so thanks everyone for the great work for 1.4 and let's test =D
