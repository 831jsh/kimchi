13:38:30 <lcorreia> no
13:38:33 <samhenri> i'm facing some issues with live migration delete function
13:38:42 <samhenri> i need help with kimchi tasks api
13:40:02 <samhenri> i've tried to add a delete function if the user has checked the option to remove vm once the migration was finished and sometimes it works, most of the time it doesn't
13:40:22 <samhenri> i think kimchi is trying to delete the vm before the migration was finished
13:40:50 <samhenri> and then if i check the output by curl, it returns "Unexpected exception: KCHVM0058E: Failed to migrate virtual machine ubuntu-live-clone-10 due error: internal error: guest unexpectedly quit"
13:41:19 <samhenri> i don't know if a timeout would solve this, because the larger the disk the longer it would require to finish the migration, right?
13:41:20 <alinefm> samhenri, you need to pool the task until it get completed
13:41:36 <alinefm> only when the status == finished, you can delete the vm
13:42:04 <alinefm> POST /plugins/vms/<name>/migrate {<Task resource>}
13:42:23 <samhenri> ok, is there any example of how to do that with tasks api? i mean, any other feature that does something similar?
13:42:25 <alinefm> GET /plugins/kimchi/tasks/<task id> on every 5 seconds
13:42:45 <alinefm> check the GET return and verify the 'status'
13:43:09 <alinefm> if it is "finished" => delete the vm (DELETE /plugins/vms/<name>
13:43:25 <alinefm> samhenri, create/clone vms
13:43:40 <alinefm> samhenri, you will need to use the trackTask() helper
13:44:13 <samhenri> ok, I will see what I can do
13:44:35 <alinefm> ok
13:44:39 <alinefm> ping me on any problem
13:45:14 <samhenri> sure
13:45:39 <alinefm> anything else?
13:46:36 <samhenri> we're also facing some issues with qemu driver for memory hotplug
13:46:38 <lbianc> alinefm: nop
13:46:44 <alinefm> samhenri, which issues?
13:47:42 <samhenri> i know that ubuntu 14.04 is not supported but do you know if theres any workaround to install libvirt latest version?
13:48:40 <samhenri> the official repo points to 1.2.2 but memory hotplug requires >= 1.2.14
13:50:00 <alinefm> samhenri, you can download the latest libvirt packages provided by ubuntu
13:50:12 <alinefm> or add the ubuntu repositories which have the newer versions
13:50:20 <samhenri> ok
13:50:21 <alinefm> but I DO NOT recommend you do that
13:50:33 <alinefm> it is better to use ubuntu 15.10
13:51:36 <alinefm> samhenri, anything else?
13:51:53 <samhenri> nope
13:52:47 <alinefm> so thanks everyone for joining!
