13:10:47 <alinefm> #topic Open Discussion
13:11:02 <alinefm> any topics to discuss today?
13:11:57 <ziviani> hi, just a quick question about the feature tests
13:12:03 <alinefm> sure
13:12:35 <ziviani> I made some measures yesterday, it's not taking long, actually it's fast from the moment I start the server
13:12:42 <ziviani> until it gets fully responsive
13:13:02 <ziviani> (i mean the capabilities feature)
13:14:06 <samhenri> I have a question about the accessibility tests/issues @ github. Can't we group them by panel or tab?
13:14:21 <alinefm> ziviani, really?
13:14:22 <ziviani> alinefm, the problem was on the list of pci devices, right?
13:14:38 <alinefm> ziviani, I am on Fedora 23 and the features tests take a long time to complete
13:14:50 <rotru> ziviani,  yeap, they are fast, usually, one or two hangs
13:14:51 <ziviani> alinefm, yes, I'll continue with that measurement on other systems
13:14:58 <alinefm> ziviani, at least, it takes a long time to get the ""Feature Tests completed" on log
13:15:13 <alinefm> ziviani, I think it is because of the NFS feature tests
13:15:25 <alinefm> ziviani, I don't think we need to link all the feature tests with server start up
13:15:26 <ziviani> alinefm, mine was taken 0.05 segs, considering nfs tests as well
13:15:35 <alinefm> ziviani, which OS?
13:15:44 <ziviani> alinefm, but it was good to know, I 'll certainly test it on other systems too
13:15:45 <rotru> ziviani,  yeap, in Fedora, the problem is NFS
13:15:48 <ziviani> alinefm, ubuntu
13:16:03 <alinefm> ziviani, maybe that is the difference
13:16:28 <ziviani> rotru, alinefm good, thanks for that information, i'll check it on fedora
13:16:40 <alinefm> ziviani, IMO we should start almost all feature tests on resource initialization and keep only the ISO streaming test linked to server start up
13:17:00 <alinefm> ziviani, the ISO streaming test depends on server to be up and running
13:17:39 <alinefm> ziviani, maybe it's worth to verify if the NFS test (or other one) still makes sense with the latest distro versions
13:17:59 <ziviani> alinefm, yes, I'll do it
13:18:02 <alinefm> probably we can remove some of them if libvirt/qemu get updated or something like it
13:18:31 <rotru> alinefm,  I would test the versions
13:18:32 <rotru> =P
13:19:43 <ziviani> alinefm, 'start almost all feature tests on resource initialization' â†’ this would make difference when kimchi is installed in the system, with the service properly configured, right?
13:20:19 <alinefm> rotru, hehehe
13:20:24 <alinefm> rotru, I will not comment on that =P
13:21:00 <alinefm> ziviani, not sure I understood your question
13:21:09 <ziviani> alinefm, I mean, if I start my kimchi, cloned from github by hand, it would be still linked to the server start up
13:21:18 <alinefm> ziviani, no
13:21:30 <alinefm> ziviani, take a look in the model/config.py file in the CapabilitiesModel()
13:21:47 <alinefm> ziviani, you will see the set_capabilities() is linked with the cherrypy start up
13:22:19 <ziviani> alinefm, yes, just saw that 'cherrypy.engine.subscribe('start', self._set_capabilities)'
13:22:20 <alinefm> which means, it will wait some time to start doing the tests - until the cherrypy server has reached the start up level required there
13:22:25 <alinefm> ziviani, correct
13:22:44 <ziviani> alinefm, now I got it, only iso streaming should be there
13:22:57 <alinefm> ziviani, correct
13:22:59 <ziviani> alinefm, rotru thank you again :)
13:23:12 <alinefm> ziviani, if we move all the feature tests to CapibilitiesModel.__init__(), they will start earlier
13:23:21 <ziviani> perfect
13:23:25 <alinefm> and probably reduce the time in some way
13:24:00 <ziviani> makes sense to me
13:24:04 <alinefm> ziviani, in addition to that, a request to /config/capabilities is made prior to get all the feature tests completed we should raise an error IMO
13:24:19 <alinefm> today we are returning inconsistent data
13:24:33 <alinefm> which is leading the UI to disable some feature which may be enabled
13:25:10 <ziviani> hmmm
13:25:13 <alinefm> that will imply to change the way the UI gets the /config/capabilities result
13:25:22 <alinefm> on error, wait some seconds and request again...
13:25:25 <alinefm> until get the information
13:25:43 <ziviani> keep polling the server until it gets the final answer
13:25:44 <ziviani> ok
13:25:51 <alinefm> yeap
13:26:52 <alinefm> ziviani, is it ok for you? any more doubts about feature tests and capabilities?
13:27:10 <ziviani> alinefm, no, it's pretty clear now, thank you :)
13:27:24 <alinefm> yw
13:27:49 <alinefm> samhenri, do you mean to group the issues according to panel?
13:28:01 <alinefm> I can create labels for that if it can help
13:28:16 <samhenri_> alinefm yes
13:28:59 <alinefm> samhenri, by tab name is enough?
13:29:15 <samhenri_> alinefm it will help a lot
13:29:25 <alinefm> ok
13:29:29 <alinefm> anything else?
13:30:07 <samhenri_> nope
13:32:18 <alinefm> danielhb, lcorreia peterpennings pvital ramonn rotru, what about you? any more topics for today?
13:32:30 <lcorreia> alinefm, not from me
13:32:35 <pvital> not from me
13:32:36 <ramonn> not from me alinefm
13:32:45 <rotru> alinefm,  I would like to ask about the logs
13:32:49 <peterpennings> I have one doubt
13:32:58 <alinefm> rotru, sure
13:33:18 <rotru> alinefm,  we talked about move logs from setting to another tab.... should we (I) ?
13:33:41 <rotru> alinefm,  than we must create an issue in order to don't forget this
13:33:50 <rotru> alinefm,  in WOK
13:33:53 <alinefm> it was a request from lagarcia
13:34:45 <alinefm> rotru, with plugins management, I agree it is better to keep the logs in a tab "Dashboard" (suggestions are welcome) and use "Settings" to manage plugins and so
13:35:50 <lcorreia> alinefm, rotru I agree, logs don't make sense under settings
13:36:32 <alinefm> rotru, said that, we just need to rename the tab now
13:36:40 <rotru> alinefm,  do we have more things to add to the "Dashboard" tab  ?
13:36:52 <alinefm> rotru, and when doing the UI for plugins management, create a new tab named 'Settings'
13:37:29 <alinefm> rotru, I can't think in anything right now
13:37:41 <alinefm> need to check the feature requests for wok
13:38:03 <alinefm> but I can only remember about management features
13:38:26 <alinefm> rotru, is your suggestion to name the tab as "Logs"?
13:38:59 <rotru> alinefm,  yes, I would suggest this ... leave as Logs , at this moment ... we can rearrange in the future, if needed
13:41:50 <alinefm> rotru, ok for me
13:41:52 <lcorreia> alinefm, rotru "request log" is more specific if you prefer to avoid confusion with access/error logs
13:43:05 <alinefm> lcorreia, rotru "User Logs"
13:43:06 <alinefm> ?
13:43:59 <lcorreia> alinefm, works as well
13:45:44 <rotru> alinefm, lcorreia  I would use "Logs" for the tab name and "User Logs" or "User Request Logs"  for the section  .... then we would not have problems adding new section to provide functionalities related to ACCESS/ERROR logs
13:46:45 <rotru> alinefm, lcorreia  but, like I said, this is just a label and easy to change before final release, so I am ok to use User Logs in the tab name at this moment
13:47:14 <alinefm> rotru, ok
13:47:37 <rotru> (and  I think we do not have plans to create access/error logs functionality for 2.2 )
13:47:42 <rotru> :)
13:47:49 <alinefm> yes
13:48:03 <lcorreia> rotru, ok, good
13:48:24 <rotru> alinefm, go ahead
13:49:11 <alinefm> any other topic?
13:49:20 <peterpennings> I have one little doubt
13:49:31 <peterpennings> About the packages update API in gingerbase
13:50:51 <peterpennings> There is a parameter named 'depends'. Does it have only the packages which one package depends one and are not installed yet? Or does it have all packages that it depends on (including the packages taht are already installed)?
13:51:16 <alinefm> pvital, ^
13:51:22 <alinefm> I'd say all the dependencies
13:51:33 <alinefm> but it is better to confirm with pvital as he developed it
13:52:12 <pvital> peterpennings, the list of all dependencies that package needs (already installed or not)
13:52:28 <pvital> peterpennings, but, since we are doing a system update
13:52:40 <pvital> all of them must be installed
13:53:08 <peterpennings> pvital ok, I got it. Tks!
13:53:58 <alinefm> any more topics for today?
13:54:12 <pvital> peterpennings, the idea  is check if we have a match between the list of dependencies of the package selected, with the list of pakcages to be updated
13:54:55 <alinefm> peterpennings, for the UI, you just need to display a warning dialog requesting user to confirm to continue or not
13:55:29 <peterpennings> pvital, yes, that is what i'm doing!!
13:55:29 <alinefm> "To update package X the following packages will be also updated or installed: Z, W, . Do you want to continue?" Y/N
13:57:03 <peterpennings> Ok, thanks guys!
14:02:11 <alinefm> thanks everyone for joining!
14:02:16 <alinefm> some good discussions today =)
