13:15:08 <WalterNik> alinefm, yes there should be one ... wondering if we have the infrastructure completed
13:15:28 <WalterNik> alinefm, I'll clarify
13:15:48 <alinefm> ok
13:15:53 <alinefm> I was just curious about that
13:16:03 <alinefm> let me know if you need any help on that
13:16:34 <alinefm> moving on to open discussion...
13:16:35 <WalterNik> alinefm, thanks I'll talk to Chandra and come back :-)
13:16:43 <alinefm> great
13:16:49 <alinefm> #topic Open Discussion
13:17:19 <alinefm> Just some quick notes from my side:
13:17:47 <alinefm> #info Wok is on code freeze, ie, only bug fixes will be accepted upstream from now on up to the release announcement
13:18:16 <alinefm> #info I have created a new tag for wok, 2.1.0-rc1 to mark the code freeze
13:18:31 <alinefm> #info Kimchi will enter on code freeze by the end of the day today
13:18:51 <alinefm> #info All pending patches on ML for Kimchi will be applied prior to code freeze
13:19:51 <pvital> alinefm, looks like danielhb is away, but GingerBase is also in code freeze and a tag 2.1.0-rc1  was already created
13:20:13 <danielhb> #info [Gingerbase] entered code freeze yesterday
13:20:16 <alinefm> pvital, yeap! I was waiting him to come up =P
13:21:07 <danielhb> #info [Ginger*] danielhb reviewed and pushed patches upstream, created gingerbase tag, fixed a couple of RPM issues
13:21:48 <alinefm> danielhb, will ginger enter on code freeze today too?
13:22:55 <danielhb> alinefm, let me read about your Kimchi status before answering it :P
13:23:07 <WalterNik> alinefm, will other patches, beside of the bug fixes be handled in any way during the blackout phase ... like picking them into a next branch ?
13:23:13 <pvital> alinefm, when wok code freeze ends?
13:23:42 <alinefm> WalterNik, yeap
13:23:53 <danielhb> alinefm, if Kimchi code freeze starts today, so will Ginger's
13:23:54 <WalterNik> alinefm, great ... thanks
13:23:59 <alinefm> WalterNik, the feature development will not be impacted due the code freeze
13:24:19 <alinefm> WalterNik, I have not created the next branch for Wok, but I will do that once we have patches to be applied there
13:24:37 <danielhb> alinefm, only thing that will change is that the OVS backend that I'll send to the ML this week will be pushed to a next branch.
13:25:07 <WalterNik> alinefm, thats helps to keep the reviews going on. thanks
13:25:26 <alinefm> pvital, the hard code freeze for wok starts next week
13:25:27 <danielhb> WalterNik, I've sent an email saying exactly what alinefm just said, but to reinforce: I'll not create the 'next' branch until we have something that needs to be pushed there. I don't believe Gingerbase will require a next branch. Ginger will.
13:25:38 <pvital> alinefm, ok!
13:25:39 <alinefm> pvital, but in general, the code freeze ends on 2.1 announcement
13:25:54 <WalterNik> danielhb, thanks
13:26:20 <alinefm> danielhb, I am OK to postpone the code freeze for Ginger until this Friday
13:26:27 <alinefm> danielhb, so we can have the OVS backend there
13:26:32 <alinefm> but it is up to you
13:26:38 <pvital> alinefm, danielhb: would be nice to point the current issues are important and must be fixed during the code freeze
13:26:44 <alinefm> without UI, the feature will not be announced on release notes
13:27:15 <danielhb> alinefm, yeah, I am not that worried about OVS backend entering this release. Let's see how thing goes
13:27:35 <alinefm> pvital, yeap! I can do that for the existing issue but we need to test and test and test again to ensure no more new bugs are there
13:28:40 <alinefm> anything else for today?
13:29:28 <danielhb> alinefm, will you announce kimchi freeze today?
13:29:46 <alinefm> danielhb, I hope so but probably by the end of the day
13:30:02 <alinefm> danielhb, there are some pending patches on ML that I want to apply before the code freeze
13:30:49 <danielhb> alinefm, are we going to create RPMs for the same distros we have created in the last release?
13:31:26 <danielhb> alinefm, ergo Fedora23 RHEL7.2 Suse13.1 Ubuntu15.10 ?
13:31:37 <alinefm> danielhb, I plan to do that to make the tests easier
13:31:41 <danielhb> alinefm, I think we need to move on to openLeap
13:31:50 <alinefm> but I am not sure they will be available today
13:32:07 <samhenri> E estou usando o kiwi irc
13:32:07 <samhenri> I believe we can finish kimchi gallery view by the end of the day but there are some minor issues with sorting, since the guests page is always refreshing and list.js lacks documentation
13:32:08 <alinefm> danielhb, we are currently testing openSUSE 42.1 LEAP
13:32:45 <samhenri> sorry about the typo in my browser, it keeps saving previous messages
13:32:50 <alinefm> samhenri, will those some minor issues impact usability ?
13:33:45 <samhenri> The css changes no, but the sorting by name, os, and memory probably won't work as expected
13:34:24 <samhenri> But switching from one style to another is already working
13:34:24 <alinefm> hmm.. in that case, can we remove the sorting option when on gallery view?
13:34:38 <samhenri> Yes
13:35:04 <samhenri> In templates screen the sort option only appears in gallery view
13:35:10 <alinefm> so IMO we can go with that for 2.1 release
13:35:19 <alinefm> as a feature preview
13:35:20 <alinefm> =)
13:35:25 <samhenri> Ok, thanks
13:36:13 <alinefm> more topics? comments? concerns? ideas?
13:38:12 <lcorreia> no
13:38:24 <samhenri> About the accessibility investigation, are we going to validate with screen readers already or keep investigating improvements? I can think of some places that needs ARIA roles
13:38:59 <chandra> #samhenri, we just started initial investigation in this area
13:39:23 <samhenri> But probably we would need hidden placeholders telling screen reader users that something has changed
13:39:37 <samhenri> chandra, ok
13:39:38 <WalterNik> samhenri, we were thinking about using jaws screen reader
13:39:43 <chandra> by the way do we have good understanding already ? if so can we share ?
13:40:48 <samhenri> WalterNik I think we should try with nvda, it is open source
13:41:18 <WalterNik> samhenri, thanks for the pointer we'll check on that one
13:41:31 <chandra> #samhenri, please feel free to share if you have overall good understanding on what we could do ?
13:42:59 <samhenri> WalterNik If we have Mac OS X users we can get feedback on Voice Over too
13:43:42 <chandra> samhenri, I have one
13:43:49 <samhenri> chandra sure, I'll send my notes on the ml once I finish my patches
13:44:09 <chandra> samhenri, that would be great help !!! thanks
13:44:57 <WalterNik> samhenri, that's good to know ... I wasn't aware that we may have to use different screen readers so far, but it makes sense to test on the different platforms. Thanks
13:45:10 <samhenri> chandra great, the good thing about voice over is that it displays logs in the screen
13:46:28 <samhenri> chandra that way we can validate if the messages are correct, if the user is able to navigate etc
13:47:28 <chandra> Samhenri, Yes perfect, let me try out and propose any inputs from my side on this topic !!!
13:47:44 <samhenri> chandra ok!
13:49:11 <alinefm> anything else, guys?
13:49:14 <pvital> no
13:49:23 <samhenri> Nope
13:50:02 <alinefm> so thanks everyone for joining!
