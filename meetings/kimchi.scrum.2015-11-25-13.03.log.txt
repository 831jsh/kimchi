13:19:12 <alinefm> great! =)
13:19:23 <alinefm> #topic Open Discussion
13:19:31 <alinefm> I have one topic related to the code freeze
13:20:08 <alinefm> It was originally scheduled to happen today, but to be able to get the new UI done for 2.0 I propose to postpone it to this Friday
13:20:36 <alinefm> any objection?
13:20:53 <WalterNik> samhenri, by when will the Ginger UI be available ?
13:21:07 <pvital> I agree
13:21:35 <alinefm> WalterNik, also by this Friday
13:22:12 <samhenri> andreteodoro is working on ginger panels, i'll be fixing the dialogs / modal windows
13:22:24 <WalterNik> alinefm, I would like to get the chance to release the new grouping in ginger into this release
13:22:58 <WalterNik> alinefm, Chandra started on the Ginger-common side and that looks good ...
13:23:29 <alinefm> WalterNik, how much time do you need to get it done? is it blocked due the new UI?
13:23:44 <WalterNik> but in order to do this on Ginger base I understood that he needs the new UI
13:24:13 <WalterNik> alinefm, yes this is my understanding
13:24:52 <WalterNik> alinefm, but I guess if he has a private base from samhenri he could work on that one
13:24:56 <alinefm> WalterNik, so my suggestion is to have it included in the next release (wok/kimchi/ginger/gingerbase 2.1)
13:25:21 <alinefm> we need to have some time for testing prior to release
13:25:36 <alinefm> I am afraid about the amount of issues we can found
13:26:18 <alinefm> WalterNik, I was talking to danielhb to keep a 'next' branch during the code freeze phase to apply the new features patches
13:26:38 <alinefm> WalterNik, so once, we release 2.0, the master branch will be updated with 'next'
13:26:42 <WalterNik> alinefm, sure but it would be great to have the base navigation established in order to be able to continue with development ...
13:27:10 <alinefm> WalterNik, the code freeze phase is only for 2 weeks
13:27:29 <alinefm> so during that time, the new devel can be done on top of 'next' branch
13:27:44 <samhenri> WalterNik I can publish alteodoro patches in my fork if it is blocking development now
13:28:16 <WalterNik> alinefm, if we don't get it done we'll have to wait.
13:28:46 <alinefm> oh... now I understood your concern
13:28:58 <alinefm> WalterNik, as samhenri said it is better to get his patch updated for ginger
13:29:05 <alinefm> so anyone can work on top of it
13:29:16 <chandra> #info, chandra implementing split the host tab functionality into "Dashboard" and "Updates"
13:29:29 <alinefm> samhenri, I thought your branch was already updated with your last changes for kimchi/ginger new UI
13:30:09 <WalterNik> samhenri, thanks I'll ask chandra to start on that base and if it's going well we can evaluate if we'll integrate it ... otherwise it has to wait for another 2 weeks
13:30:11 <chandra> alinefm, I have tried yesterday of samhenri but it still shows old ui
13:30:34 <chandra> *ginger repository
13:30:37 <samhenri> alinefm my ginger fork is a few commits behind
13:30:44 <alinefm> WalterNik, during those 2 weeks, the team can continue to send patches and so
13:30:53 <alinefm> WalterNik, the patches will be applied on next branch
13:31:16 <alinefm> samhenri, ok - update it so chandra can work on top of it
13:31:39 <WalterNik> alinefm, that sounds good.
13:31:45 <samhenri> i can merge with current ginger master
13:32:01 <samhenri> but I don't think it will look good now because it is not finished
13:32:32 <samhenri> some panels may be finished but the dialog windows are still old-ui, it is all mixed
13:33:23 <alinefm> samhenri, np! at least we have an ideia on what is going on there and do what we can in parallel
13:34:05 <samhenri> ok
13:34:40 <WalterNik> chandra, the current outlook is to have the ginger code in by Friday ... but that wouldn't allow you to implement the new grouping on top. Aline's proposal is to implement this grouping in the next branch because this one is going to be merged to master afetr 2 weeks anyhow.
13:35:34 <WalterNik> chandra, is this ok with you ?
13:37:00 <chandra> When we say grouping we are talking withe respect ginger only right ?
13:37:23 <chandra> I can still make gingerbase grouping parallel
13:37:53 <WalterNik> chandra, good point ... since you have that one working ?
13:38:46 <chandra> yes
13:38:53 <WalterNik> alinefm, danielhb, would it make sense to get the new grouping for ginger-common integrated this week ?
13:38:57 <chandra> I will deliver patch as early as possible
13:39:14 <chandra> in a day ...
13:39:31 <alinefm> WalterNik, yeap
13:39:39 <alinefm> it is done by Friday it will be in for 2.0
13:39:53 <alinefm> WalterNik, chandra I have a comment related to that so
13:40:11 <alinefm> WalterNik, chandra, I was to reply to the ML but always forget
13:40:43 <alinefm> WalterNik, chandra, Kimchi will depend on ginger base which should launch one tab IMO
13:40:47 <alinefm> the Dashboard tab
13:41:08 <alinefm> WalterNik, chandra, so for that I'd like to have the host information + host stats + debug reports in that tab
13:41:16 <chandra> yes
13:41:17 <alinefm> I saw the debug reports was moved to other tab
13:41:36 <alinefm> which will make it odd while running only kimchi + gingerbase
13:41:52 <WalterNik> alinefm, with the discussed split it would launch 3 tabs: Dashboard, Updates and Administration
13:42:09 <alinefm> WalterNik, chandra what do you think in have those 3 functionalities (host info + host stats + debug report) in the Dashboard?
13:42:48 <alinefm> WalterNik, really?! the last time I read about it there would be Storage and Network tabs as well
13:43:33 <WalterNik> alinefm, only if ginger-common is installed
13:44:01 <WalterNik> alinefm, if we have ginger installed it will add network, storage and power
13:44:23 <alinefm> WalterNik, ok
13:44:44 <chandra> make sense
13:44:46 <alinefm> WalterNik, but the administration tab will contain only the debug reports?
13:44:52 <alinefm> for ginger-base
13:45:05 <alinefm> and it will be extended by ginger
13:45:06 <alinefm> ?
13:45:11 <alinefm> is that correct?
13:45:17 <chandra> yes
13:45:20 <danielhb> what is ginger-common ?
13:45:40 <alinefm> danielhb, I am assuming it is gingerbase
13:45:41 <alinefm> =P
13:45:51 <WalterNik> alinefm, assuming User Management, Configuration Backup and SEP Config is in Ginger then yes
13:46:03 <alinefm> ok
13:46:16 <WalterNik> alinefm, sorry ginger-common is gingerbase
13:46:30 <alinefm> ok ok
13:47:38 <alinefm> anything else, team?
13:49:00 <WalterNik> no, not from my side.
13:49:25 <chandra> I guess that is all from my side either
13:50:01 <alinefm> just one more update
13:50:17 <alinefm> I plan to apply all the gingerbase patches pending on ML today
13:50:23 <alinefm> and then separated it into a new git repo \o/
13:50:39 <alinefm> chandra, so you can start working on this new repo for the tabs grouping tomorrow
13:51:21 <lcorreia> \o/
13:52:39 <chandra> yep
13:53:29 <alinefm> so thanks everyone for joining!
