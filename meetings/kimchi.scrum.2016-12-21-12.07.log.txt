12:22:23 <mike-kfed> hi guys. I am trying to get kimchi running, after getting all dependencies sorted I can see the login screen
12:22:36 <mike-kfed> but login does not work
12:23:37 <mike-kfed> so I added debug output, turns out that the cherrypy.session.id changes. I assume that's why the username info is lost and I end up back at the login.html again?
12:24:47 <mike-kfed> I also installed it a second time using docker then, thinking I might have a weird environment. same behaviour (staying at login screen, haven't added debug output in docker image)
12:25:45 <mike-kfed> now I am here asking what to do to get it working. I am now on git tag wok-2.3.1 gingerbase-2.2.2 kimchi-2.3.1
12:25:59 <alinefm> hi mike-kfed
12:26:14 <alinefm> which OS are you trying to get it running?
12:26:31 <mike-kfed> I am on gentoo linux
12:26:34 <alinefm> and how are you trying to login?
12:26:40 <mike-kfed> docker image is based on debian
12:26:54 <mike-kfed> using my username (is in sudoers list) or using root
12:27:12 <alinefm> any error when you try to login?
12:27:28 <mike-kfed> no error
12:27:51 <alinefm> are you access it on firefox? could you check firebug logs to see any JS error is there
12:28:40 <mike-kfed> checked for JS errors on chrome, none came up. I'll retry with the fox, just a sec
12:32:28 <mike-kfed> alinefm: both browsers have the warning about synchronous XMLHttpRequests shouldn't be used
12:32:45 <mike-kfed> firefox complains that opensans has a too large subtable
12:33:00 <mike-kfed> else no errors in console
12:33:52 <mike-kfed> I am using it over http port 8010 on localhost, is not using https the issue?
12:35:31 <alinefm> I am not sure
12:35:46 <alinefm> try to use "http://localhost:8000"
12:36:02 <alinefm> you can also run wokd manually to get more output
12:36:04 <alinefm> service wokd stop
12:36:19 <mike-kfed> I only run wokd manually
12:36:21 <alinefm> wokd --environment=dev (this option is to get more output)
12:36:26 <alinefm> paste me the output, please
12:36:34 <mike-kfed> ah, okay I'll do that
12:40:22 <mike-kfed> it complains that spice-html5 is missing, I'll install that first, then I'll paste you the output
12:52:16 <mike-kfed> okay no clue how to get spice-html5 for gentoo (spice server is installed)
12:52:20 <mike-kfed> here is the output: https://paste.fedoraproject.org/510483/82324713/
12:54:53 <alinefm> mike-kfed, try to login and check the output
12:55:04 <alinefm> there should be an error somewhere =)
12:55:12 <alinefm> any reason to do not try https?
12:59:28 <mike-kfed> well for a quicktest I don't need it
12:59:38 <mike-kfed> I will use nginx to proxy it
13:00:51 <mike-kfed> this is the only non http log line when logging in
13:00:53 <mike-kfed> INFO:wok_request_logger:{"info": {"status": 200, "zone": "CET", "ip": "127.0.0.1", "app": "", "req": "POST", "user": "htd", "time": "14:00:23", "date": "2016-12-21"}, "message": {"code": "WOKROOT0001L", "params": {"username": "htd"}}, "id": "cb9188b8-f943-433f-8061-86eefb9a9388", "error": null}
13:02:36 <alinefm> well, seems you have logged in
13:03:00 <mike-kfed> I know, that's why I started to hack around in woks auth.py to see what happens
13:03:15 <mike-kfed> it must be something with cherrypy session
13:04:10 <mike-kfed> (all my hacks are gone, right now git-tag 2.3.1 is in use)
13:05:41 <mike-kfed> i have cherrypy 3.8.0 installed, too new?
13:05:56 <alinefm> no
13:06:10 <alinefm> try to access that uri directly https://localhost:8001/#plugins/gingerbase/tabs/host-dashboard
13:07:21 <mike-kfed> this redirects me to login.html#plugins/...
13:08:51 <mike-kfed> the docker image has cherrypy 3.5.0, but login does not work there either
13:17:12 <mike-kfed> I'll try ssl next, but i guess that's not the problem
13:18:43 <alinefm> the docker image is debian, right?
13:18:56 <alinefm> we have tested 2.3.1 releases on debian without problems
13:19:11 <alinefm> gentoo has not been tested by us =/
13:26:15 <mike-kfed> I know gentoo is not on your list, that's why i tried the docker thing
13:27:24 <mike-kfed> I have an existing centos7 vm. but to setup libvirt and stuff in the vm just to see if it works there is a little much work
13:28:32 <mike-kfed> yes debian, based on phusion/baseimage
13:28:48 <mike-kfed> ah ubuntu even
14:00:04 <mike-kfed> aha, so ssl works. I assume because of the websocket alias
14:00:41 <mike-kfed> I would add that to the docs, that connecting directly to wokd on port 8010 is useless and a proxy is needed
14:07:05 <alinefm> mike-kfed, \o/
14:07:25 <alinefm> that is great you identified the problem
14:07:36 <mike-kfed> yes, thanks for your help
14:07:50 <mike-kfed> clicking around in the UI now, looks great
14:08:26 <mike-kfed> the only thing weird is the call to /notifications every 2 secs even though you have websockets ;)
14:09:35 <alinefm> mike-kfed, yeap! =/
14:09:49 <alinefm> we have plan to change that and use websockets for notification as well
14:09:59 <alinefm> but a lot of ideas to a small community
14:10:08 <alinefm> but with time, we can do all we want
14:10:14 <mike-kfed> small but active
14:10:34 <mike-kfed> most kvm management tools are abandoned or beasts like apache cloudstack
14:10:50 <mike-kfed> so I appreciate your work!
14:10:56 <alinefm> yeap! we will 3 releases next year
14:11:07 <alinefm> (seems I forgot to end the scrum meeting)
