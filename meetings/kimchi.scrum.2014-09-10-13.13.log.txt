13:21:50 <YuXin> hong liang is continuing to work on it
13:21:58 <YuXin> today
13:22:33 <YuXin> seems like he got some blocker on upload
13:22:48 <alinefm> YuXin, do you know which blocker?
13:22:59 <YuXin> I would like to ask him to send patch of download first
13:23:18 <YuXin> he always fail to get upload to work
13:23:21 <alinefm> yeap - I've just checked the ML and the download patches are there
13:24:33 <alinefm> YuXin, ok - I will try to talk to him tonight to see if I can help in anything
13:24:43 <alinefm> does this blocker is on UI or backend? do you know?
13:24:51 <YuXin> ok, I will look into upload with him together tomorrow to see whether we can get it done together
13:25:20 <YuXin> he told me that he has followed the REST API, but always failed
13:25:59 <alinefm> ok
13:26:14 <alinefm> let's move on to open discussion
13:26:18 <YuXin> He has been working with Royce together to try to get it done, but still has not addressed that

13:27:44 <baude> #info baude submitted patch to edit graphics type, add serial; waiting for acceptance to submit patch to rewrite the edit mechanism
13:27:45 <YuXin> from source code
13:27:50 <YuXin> https://github.com/kimchi-project/kimchi/issues/412
13:28:34 <alinefm> YuXin, oh, there is a patch on ML for it
13:28:38 <alinefm> I will apply today
13:28:43 <YuXin> ok
13:29:01 <alinefm> baude, I will review your patches today too =)
13:29:15 <alinefm> baude, do you know what is the process to the community uses the red hat logo?
13:29:15 <baude> my open topic for today is if anyone has considered a true netboot template.
13:29:26 <baude> alinefm, i dont unfortunately
13:29:36 <baude> alinefm, i can ask around
13:30:00 <alinefm> baude, please do
13:30:07 <alinefm> baude, about the netboot, yes
13:30:15 <baude> and?
13:30:23 <alinefm> pvital started something on backend and wenwang on the front end
13:30:28 <baude> ok
13:30:39 <alinefm> but probably will be ready just for next release
13:31:05 <baude> how about ability to select/modify boot order on a vm
13:31:30 <wenwang> alinefm: Yes, I have the back-end code and it's been hold for a while
13:32:43 <alinefm> wenwang, yeap - we can resume this work after 1.3 release
13:33:04 <alinefm> baude, also in backlog but anyone is working on it yet
13:33:20 <baude> alinefm, ok I'd be willing to do it
13:33:31 <baude> should be reasonably easy to do with the new edit mechanism
13:33:32 <wenwang> alinefm: sure
13:33:57 <alinefm> baude, sure - it is all yours =)
13:34:45 <alinefm> anything else for today?
13:35:13 <baude> alinefm, also curious if anyone would think it would be a good add to be able to specific a vm's mac address?
13:35:38 <baude> able to define ^^
13:35:50 <alinefm> what are the advantages in doing it?
13:36:02 <alinefm> netboot?
13:36:08 <baude> yeah, that is the primary use
13:36:37 <baude> wenwang, im curious, have you tested netboot on a power system or just x86 ?
13:37:59 <wenwang> baude: I just got pvital's code in the back-end and haven't tried it yes due to some work issues
13:38:33 <baude> ok
13:38:42 <baude> im unable to make netboot work on power with a fedora host fwiw
13:38:52 <alinefm> baude, I think when selecting a netboot template to create a vm we can add an option to specify the mac address
13:39:05 <baude> alinefm, ok i will noodle on that
13:39:22 <wenwang> baude: I was blocked by the environment setting for the netboot, so...
13:39:26 <alinefm> but the default option would be "automatic generate a mac"
13:39:47 <baude> alinefm, i was thinking that specifying a mac could be an edit function on the defined vm
13:39:55 <baude> that way the default behaviour was always respected
13:40:15 <baude> we can discuss further in the future
13:40:31 <baude> wenwang, ok, if you get it to work, will you ping me?
13:40:40 <wenwang> baude: sure
13:40:43 <baude> christyp, curious if you have tried this? ^^
13:41:07 <alinefm> baude, yeap - seems it is a better design
13:41:32 <alinefm> baude, maybe pvital did as he did the backend patches
13:41:41 <alinefm> hope he tested his patches =)
13:42:47 <baude> well i think it works on powerkvm ... just maybe not fedora which implies missing patches or mismatch versions
13:42:50 <baude> :(
13:43:39 <vianac> alinefm, I have one topic to discuss
13:43:49 <alinefm> I will try to ask around about it
13:43:52 <alinefm> and let you know
13:43:55 <alinefm> vianac, yes
13:44:11 <vianac> regarding the default parameter 'name' value patch I sent this week
13:44:34 <vianac> I was assuming the parameter' file' when uploading a volume was the original file name, but it's not
13:44:38 <vianac> so my patch won't work
13:44:47 <vianac> what can we use as a default 'name' then?
13:44:59 <vianac> I guess we'll have to make it required...
13:45:15 <vianac> or is there a way to get the file name from it?
13:45:27 <vianac> (I still don't understand that parameter >.<)
13:46:00 <alinefm> the file parameter is a file descriptor
13:46:09 <alinefm> I think we can get the file name from it
13:46:15 <alinefm> let me do a quick test
13:47:32 <alinefm> >>> fd = open("/home/alinefm/kimchi/COPYING", "rb")
13:47:32 <alinefm> >>> fd.name
13:47:32 <alinefm> '/home/alinefm/kimchi/COPYING'
13:47:35 <alinefm> vianac, ^
13:48:18 <vianac> alinefm, ok, I'll try it
13:49:46 <vianac> alinefm, but I still think 'file' is not a regular file descriptor
13:49:55 <christyp> baude: no, i haven't tried netbooting at all
13:50:07 <vianac> in the upload code, it uses "file.fd.<something>"
13:50:27 <vianac> fd = open(...); I cant make fd.fd
13:50:30 <alinefm> vianac, agree - but there is something related to it too
13:50:34 <vianac> ok
13:50:42 <vianac> ill look into it...
13:50:55 <alinefm> vianac, thanks! ping me if you need help
13:50:59 <vianac> alinefm, ok
13:53:04 <alinefm> anything else?
13:54:40 <alinefm> apparently not
13:54:47 <alinefm> thanks everyone for joining
