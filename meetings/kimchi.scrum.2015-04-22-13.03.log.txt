13:12:44 <alinefm> thanks a lot baude to make it happen
13:13:13 <baude> i am recieving some odd feedback from users on some of it, but its in
13:13:45 <alinefm> baude, really? could you share those feedbacks with us? so we can try to address them
13:13:53 <baude> for example, has anyone seen an issue related to login where using the fully qualified host and domain name wont login but using it by ip and just the host name will ?
13:14:56 <alinefm> I haven't seen it before
13:15:09 <alinefm> in fact, I have never done a test like it
13:16:25 <alinefm> baude, you can open issues on github so we can track and investigate
13:16:30 <baude> sure
13:16:44 <baude> also complaints about the lack of customizable MAC addresses
13:16:55 <baude> and the granularity of cpus
13:17:14 <alinefm> baude, granularity of cpus? we have it on templates
13:17:26 <baude> ok i will look closer
13:17:42 <baude> it now does the threads/cpus
