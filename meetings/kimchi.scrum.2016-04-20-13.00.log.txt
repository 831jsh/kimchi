13:04:03 <alinefm> #info [kimchi] socorro In addition to eliminating all radio buttons and only have one panel, a proposal was made to add icons to distinguish between local and remote ISOs and also add filtering.

13:12:23 <alinefm> #topic Open Discussion
13:12:32 <alinefm> what do you want to discuss today?
13:13:17 <pvital> alinefm, I have a question....
13:13:45 <alinefm> go ahead
13:14:31 <pvital> in Kimchi issue #845, I replied to the person who reported the issue, but he hasn't replied to me
13:14:48 <pvital> how long should we wait until ask to close the issue?
13:15:42 <alinefm> I'd say one month
13:15:54 <alinefm> it should be time enough to someone take an update on the issue
13:16:28 <alinefm> pvital, have you explicitly call the person attention there using @<nick> ?
13:16:49 <pvital> alinefm, I think so
13:16:53 <pvital> :-P
13:17:13 <alinefm> ok - so let's wait some weeks and with no response we can close it
13:17:44 <alinefm> pvital, what do you think?
13:17:59 <pvital> that's OK for me!
13:18:20 <alinefm> pvital, I also want to talk to you about the libvirt events patches
13:18:32 <pvital> OMG....
13:18:38 <pvital> let's go
13:18:38 <alinefm> I was testing it before this meeting and I saw some errors while running the tests
13:18:45 <alinefm> https://paste.fedoraproject.org/357767/57922146/
13:18:57 <alinefm> pvital, also there are some duplicated log inputs related to that
13:19:34 <alinefm> I was planning to merge the PCI attach/detach patches (as they do not depend on libvirt events) today and ask you to take care about those issues later
13:19:37 <alinefm> what do you think?
13:20:04 <pvital> libvirt:  error : invalid argument: event callback already tracked
13:20:09 <pvital> alinefm, ^this?
13:20:43 <alinefm> yes
13:20:46 <alinefm> and also:
13:20:47 <alinefm> TypeError: not all arguments converted during string formatting
13:20:47 <alinefm> Logged from file vmhostdevs.py, line 449
13:20:52 <pvital> interesting. may be the test cases are instantiating the libvirt class more than once
13:21:06 <alinefm> on server starts up there are duplicated messgaes about the FEATURETEST_VM
13:21:39 <pvital> alinefm, there are not duplicated messages
13:22:04 <pvital> they are the messages generated by the libvirt events
13:22:34 <pvital> if the event happens more than once for the same guest, the message will be logged again
13:22:56 <alinefm> pvital, oh ok but those message are filling up the logs files without any useful information
13:23:15 <pvital> alinefm, they are useful
13:23:38 <pvital> they say what happened to the guest, the livecycle of it
13:23:58 <alinefm> pvital, we already log those actions through the API log
13:25:36 <pvital> alinefm, really??? that's interesting because I've never saw a log message when the XML of a guest was updated, or the guest was destroyed (shutdown) or restarted or started up
13:26:12 <pvital> but OK, the pci attach/detach is more important for the moment
13:26:42 <pvital> them I can fix the libvirt events stuff and submit new patches if necessary
13:27:27 <alinefm> pvital, you can also see those logs using the user log activity on wok
13:27:47 <alinefm> pvital, I only don't want to mess the log files with information which will be not useful
13:28:01 <alinefm> pvital, we can log that info on debug only mode, for example
13:28:19 <alinefm> or only enable libvirt events without registering any event right now
13:28:30 <alinefm> lcorreia_ will use on future for ENOSPC events
13:29:01 <pvital> Ok
13:29:24 <alinefm> pvital, I tried to apply only the 2 patches related to PCI attach/detach and I got a merge conflict
13:29:36 <alinefm> could you separate the patch set and resend only the PCI patches?
13:29:41 <pvital> sure
13:30:57 <alinefm> thanks
13:31:07 <alinefm> anything else for today?
13:31:46 <ziviani> no
13:33:13 <alinefm> ok
13:33:19 <alinefm> so thanks everyone for joining!
