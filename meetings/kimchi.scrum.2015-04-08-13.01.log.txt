13:13:07 <alinefm> what are the topics for today?
13:13:11 <rotru> alinefm; " create a logical pool from an existing VG"  , is that related to the 'issue' we talked other day, that logical pool disappear  if you create one ?
13:13:25 <alinefm> rotru, yes
13:13:41 <alinefm> it is the ability to create a logical pool selecting an existing VG instead of the disks
13:14:26 <rotru> alinefm;  ok, got it
13:16:11 <alinefm> and just to make everyone aware, Kimchi package was included to the Fedora testing repositories last week
13:16:36 <alinefm> which means in one or two weeks it might be on the Fedora official repositories
13:17:36 <alinefm> unfortunately, baude is not online right now, but I'd like to thank him to get it done
13:18:53 <lagarcia> alinefm, that's definitely great news! :)
