13:05:58 <alinefm> anything else to add to the agenda?
13:06:13 <pvital> no
13:07:15 <alinefm> so let's get started
13:07:22 <alinefm> #topic Scrum meeting format
13:08:03 <alinefm> First of all, the scrum meetings from now on will be on every Wed (as you may know from my email to the ML)
13:08:24 <alinefm> And as we have my projects now, I'd like to discuss the best format for this meeting
13:08:54 <alinefm> I don't think we have topics to have a separated scrum meeting per project and as they depend on each other I'd like to continue with only one scrum meeting
13:09:18 <alinefm> my proposal is to separate the status per projects
13:09:25 <alinefm> one status topic per project
13:09:29 <alinefm> what do you think about it?
13:09:38 <alinefm> more ideas? comments? concerns?
13:10:21 <samhenri> I agree
13:10:54 <lcorreia> agree
13:11:20 <ziviani> ok
13:11:24 <pvital> looks like good! let's do it
13:12:10 <OtavioLF> ok
13:12:25 <alteodoro> agree
13:13:07 <rotru> +1
13:13:37 <alinefm> danielhb, do you think ginger/gingerbase may be included in this scrum meeting?
13:14:57 <rotru> alinefm,  should we have subtopics , per project ?
13:15:12 <danielhb> alinefm, I have nothing against it, but we need to consider that at least half of the active ginger community is in India. I don't know if this timeslot works for them
13:15:48 <alinefm> danielhb, good point! I am open to discuss a new time for this meeting if needed
13:16:01 <alinefm> rotru, I haven't thought about it yet
13:16:05 <alinefm> rotru, any suggestion?
13:16:29 <danielhb> alinefm, this discussion would be suitable for the ML
13:16:55 <alinefm> danielhb, yeap!
13:17:06 <rotru> alinefm,  thinking
13:17:09 <alinefm> danielhb, on which ML? hehe
13:17:24 <danielhb> alinefm, ginger
13:17:28 <alinefm> danielhb, ok
13:17:37 <danielhb> alinefm, and if a new timeslot is required, then we'll need to use kimchi's
13:17:45 <alinefm> ok ok
13:17:58 <alinefm> moving on...
13:18:07 <alinefm> #topic 2.1 releases
13:18:22 <alinefm> #info Wok schedule: https://github.com/kimchi-project/wok/wiki/Planning-2.1
13:18:38 <alinefm> #info Kimchi schedule: https://github.com/kimchi-project/kimchi/wiki/Planning-2.1
13:19:01 <alinefm> danielhb, do you want to share the ginger/gingerbase schedules too?
13:19:18 <danielhb> alinefm, sure
13:19:43 <danielhb> #info Ginger schedule https://github.com/kimchi-project/ginger/wiki/Planning-2.1
13:19:53 <danielhb> #info Ginger-base schedule https://github.com/kimchi-project/gingerbase/wiki/Planning-2.1
13:20:52 <alinefm> I also created a todo list for wok and kimchi
13:21:08 <alinefm> feel free to update it when needed
13:21:23 <rotru> alinefm,  something like:
13:21:25 <rotru> Wok:
13:21:25 <rotru> Community Status (new patches included / bugs fixed / changes in community behavior)
13:21:25 <rotru> Critical Issues
13:21:25 <rotru> Features/RFCs (discuss about new features, new ideas from mailing list)
13:21:25 <rotru> Kimchi:
13:21:25 <alinefm> by now I have only listed what have missed from 2.0 releases
13:21:27 <rotru> Community Status
13:21:28 <rotru> Critical Issues
13:21:30 <rotru> Features / RFCs
13:22:11 <alinefm> #info Wok 2.1 todo: https://github.com/kimchi-project/wok/wiki/Todo-2.1
13:22:21 <alinefm> #info Kimchi 2.1 todo: https://github.com/kimchi-project/kimchi/wiki/Todo-2.1
13:22:44 <alinefm> rotru, maybe join status + issues into one sub-topic
13:23:14 <rotru> sure
13:23:15 <alinefm> danielhb, do you have a todo list for ginger/gingerbase?
13:23:39 <pvital> rotru, alinefm: nice idea, but this kind of division will take 2hrs to handle by IRC
13:24:43 <alinefm> heheh
13:25:16 <alinefm> or we keep only the status separated per project and discuss anything else on "Open Discussion" session
13:25:41 <alinefm> any question about the 2.1 schedules and todo list?
13:26:06 <ramonn> #info ramonn sent patches for installation media. We discussed some points and there are some things to consider before applying
13:26:11 <alinefm> alteodoro, danielhb, lcorreia, pvital, ramonn, rotru, samhenri, ziviani ^
13:26:16 <samhenri> i think we may need to edit some of wok widgets as we develop the ui for the new features in Kimchi
13:26:22 <ramonn> #info ramonn got some errors with urllib. Sent patches for fixing it
13:26:39 <lcorreia> no
13:26:44 <alinefm> PLEASE! focus on this topic "2.1 releases" first
13:26:53 <alinefm> we will move to status and open discussion soon
13:27:22 <samhenri> with the given deadlines we would have to create the wdigets first and then move to kimchi/ginger/gingerbase
13:27:37 <danielhb> alinefm, ginger TODO for 2.1: https://github.com/kimchi-project/ginger/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3AGinger2.1
13:27:45 <danielhb> alinefm, gingerbase TODO for 2.1: https://github.com/kimchi-project/gingerbase/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3AGingerbase2.1
13:28:05 <danielhb> alinefm, 23 bugs and 7 bugs respectively
13:28:15 <alinefm> thanks, danielhb!
13:28:51 <alinefm> samhenri, "create the wdigets first and then move to kimchi/ginger/gingerbase" ?
13:29:01 <alinefm> do you mean "then use on.." ?
13:29:10 <samhenri> yes
13:29:19 <alinefm> ok
13:29:31 <samhenri> what i meant is that wok development phase should end with kimchi
13:29:49 <alinefm> samhenri, wok devel will end before Kimchi
13:30:02 <alinefm> just because wok needs to be stable for the plugins
13:30:19 <samhenri> but what if we find a critical bug in one of wok.*.js widgets?
13:30:39 <alinefm> critical bug can be solved untill hard code freeze
13:30:42 <lbianc> alinefm: There are some questions about the todo list, but on a technical way, like requirements. Are going to discuss these kind of things in this meeting?
13:31:04 <alinefm> lbianc, yeap!
13:31:07 <alinefm> just a second =)
13:31:13 <lbianc> alinefm: ok :)
13:31:24 <alinefm> samhenri, the devel phase is for new features
13:32:04 <alinefm> samhenri, code freeze => NO new feature will be accepted on master branch ONLY BUG FIXES
13:32:18 <alinefm> samhenri, hard code freeze => ONLY critial bug fixes are accepted on master branch
13:32:24 <alinefm> samhenri, makes sense?
13:32:47 <samhenri> yes it does
13:33:40 <alinefm> do you still see problems in having wok devel ending one week before kimchi's?
13:34:26 <alinefm> samhenri, ^
13:34:39 <samhenri> we still have to fix wok.list and wok.grid for gingerbase and...
13:34:58 <samhenri> we currently have some mockups for networks that I think we we'll have to create new widgets
13:35:33 <samhenri> there are some features that might need new widgets as well
13:35:49 <alinefm> ok
13:36:02 <samhenri> or at least the current widgets will have new parameters to maintain compatibility
13:36:07 <alinefm> we first need to think about the new features and what it will require on wok
13:36:11 <alinefm> and do the wok devel first
13:36:47 <alinefm> if you already have a list of what is needed on wok, it is still better
13:36:55 <samhenri> i don't
13:37:09 <alinefm> can you do that?
13:37:39 <samhenri> i don't have mockups for all the features
13:37:58 <alinefm> what do you need to create the mockups?
13:38:06 <samhenri> the requirements
13:38:08 <alinefm> I mean, is there something blocking you?
13:38:37 <lbianc> alinefm, samhenri: It will be discussed better on the technical part
13:38:55 <lbianc> since there are some specification missing
13:38:56 <alinefm> yes
13:39:19 <alinefm> but I want to have an agreement in the schedule by now
13:40:46 <alinefm> is the silence an agreement? =)
13:41:04 <ziviani> ok
13:41:07 <OtavioLF> no
13:41:10 <lbianc> alinefm: Since can we discuss each item first?
13:41:19 <OtavioLF> silence is not na agree
13:41:33 <alinefm> so... what is the new schedule proposal?
13:41:52 <alinefm> why can't we end the wok devel one week before kimchi/ginger?
13:43:49 <lbianc> alinefm: yes, but since there is no dependency between them, samhenri, we have to be sure that no wodgets will be developed after the wok's freeze, right?
13:43:57 <samhenri> yes
13:44:01 <samhenri> correct
13:44:48 <pvital> alinefm, if the development items are only those listed in todo (I mean, the list will not increase), IMHO, there's no problem to close it one week before.
13:46:20 <pvital> lbianc, I guess the process is clear: no new features will be included during the two freeze slots
13:46:21 <alinefm> pvital, probably the **backend** list for kimchi will increase
13:47:22 <alinefm> OtavioLF, samhenri, lbianc, so... what is the conclusion?
13:47:32 <pvital> alinefm, so, I think this will dangerous, since the new items have dependencies with items on kimchi and other projects
13:48:02 <pvital> 1 week will be too short to test and adapt (or finish something)
13:48:04 <samhenri> pvital yes
13:48:10 <samhenri> pvital exactly
13:48:13 <alinefm> plopix, how dangerous a kimchi feature can be for wok or ginger or gingebase?
13:48:16 <alinefm> ops...
13:48:19 <alinefm> plopix, sorry
13:48:21 <alinefm> pvital, ^
13:48:38 <pvital> alinefm, no
13:48:45 <pvital> alinefm, it's the opposite
13:48:47 <alinefm> samhenri, the same question for you and remember I am talking about increasing the BACKEND list
13:49:08 <alinefm> pvital, I said the BACKEND list for KIMCHI may increase
13:49:16 <pvital> alinefm, a wok item can be dangerous to finish a kimchi item in only 1 week before the end of devel slot]
13:49:20 <alinefm> I dind't say the WOK list will increase
13:50:00 <lbianc> alinefm: our concern is about the missing specifications, like, we dont know if there is a feature in kimchi that requires a new feature in wok yet
13:50:25 <samhenri> suppose we think we finished a new widget that is included in wok for a new feature, e.g. OVS or Linux bridge and it is included in Wok
13:50:55 <samhenri> but then between 02/24 and 03/02 we find out that something was missing
13:51:05 <alinefm> lbianc, all the specifications from what we have listed by now MUST be completed by the end of this week
13:51:23 <samhenri> not a bug, but that was completly off or wrong
13:52:01 <alinefm> why would it be completely off or wrong?
13:52:24 <samhenri> something like live migration delete function that doesn't work and had to be schedule to this release
13:52:25 <alinefm> I understand the concerns about the lack of specifications
13:52:48 <alinefm> but it must be solved by the end of this week
13:53:07 <alinefm> if, even after that, we devel a widget or anything else wrong, it will me our fault
13:53:16 <alinefm> s/me/be
13:53:35 <alinefm> it is not depend on one week more or less
13:53:38 <alinefm> makes sense?
13:53:56 <samhenri> my concern is that because of different development cycles we would have to postpone one feature if a widget is not working properly
13:54:14 <lbianc> alinefm samhenri: So, if the specifications be ready this week, we can give priority to the dependent wok items, ok? To be sure this problem will not happen.
13:54:28 <samhenri> yes
13:54:46 <alinefm> lbianc, exactly
13:55:26 <lbianc> alinefm: So, for me it's ok. samhenri?
13:56:18 <lbianc> samhenri: sorry. So, I agree
13:57:09 <samhenri> agreed
13:58:11 <alinefm> lbianc, samhenri, the idea behind having wok/gingerbase on freeze one week before kimchi/ginger is because they are dependency for other plugins
13:58:28 <alinefm> so if we can have them stable sooner it is better
13:59:14 <lbianc> alinefm: yes I agree, but just to keep in main that this kind of issue can happen if any specification be missing
13:59:24 <lbianc> mind*
13:59:42 <alinefm> lbianc, yeap! so let's solve all doubts and lack of specifications this week
13:59:48 <alinefm> let's move on
13:59:52 <lbianc> alinefm: good :)
14:00:11 <alinefm> (I plan to do that on open discussion session)
14:00:14 <alinefm> #topic Status

14:07:02 <alinefm> ramonn, thanks
14:07:10 <alinefm> rotru, anything else to share?
14:07:21 <ramonn> nop
14:08:16 <alinefm> ok... let's move on due the time
14:08:39 <alinefm> I know we are over time but I want to discuss the feature specifications
14:09:08 <alinefm> I will properly upload the meeting log the github.io, if anyone wants to check later
14:09:18 <alinefm> #topic Open Discuss
14:09:34 <alinefm> lbianc, samhenri, can we start item by item from the list?
14:09:42 <samhenri> yes
14:09:53 <alinefm> let's start from wok
14:10:04 <alinefm> - Create a new logo for Wok
14:10:16 <alinefm> samhenri, lbianc, what do you need for it?
14:11:08 <samhenri> i know that we already discussed this before, but we need some sort of "briefing doc" so we can start with some ideas and present some options
14:12:05 <samhenri> i meant, the style, colors, images that you want to use as reference
14:13:34 <alinefm> oh... I am not good with that, but I can think in some options and share with you
14:13:50 <alinefm> I first have though on a pan for the logo
14:14:12 <alinefm> but some people said it should be abstract as Kimchi logo does not represents the kimchi food
14:14:28 <samhenri> exactly
14:15:52 <alinefm> so my only suggestion is, you have freedom to do the logo as you think it is better
14:15:56 <alinefm> =D
14:16:12 <alinefm> samhenri, is it good or bad?
14:16:14 <alinefm> heheh
14:16:25 <OtavioLF> ok
14:16:25 <samhenri> ok
14:17:04 <alinefm> samhenri, if you have doubts about colors or anything else, I can help on that area by giving my suggestion as user
14:17:26 <alinefm> next one:
14:17:31 <alinefm> - Display plugins logo on login page and "About" dialog
14:17:51 <samhenri> this is easy, i suggested using something like Juju Charms login page
14:18:00 <alinefm> yeap!
14:18:13 <alinefm> we only need to have the API done on backend to provide the logo for UI
14:18:40 <alinefm> I'd propose to have an API /plugins/<name>/logo to provide the logo image
14:18:48 <alinefm> so on UI you just need to request it
14:18:56 <samhenri> https://jujucharms.com/about
14:19:41 <alinefm> samhenri, good pretty good for me
14:19:48 <alinefm> samhenri, we can do the same on login page
14:21:11 <samhenri> we can use the tab-ext.xml for this I guess
14:21:34 <alinefm> for the logo image path?
14:21:52 <samhenri> yes
14:22:10 <alinefm> so is there no need to create a new API /plugins/<name>/logo ?
14:22:33 <alinefm> it is simpler to do that way (by using tab-ext)
14:22:39 <alinefm> if you agree, let's do that way
14:22:50 <samhenri> yes, something like this
14:23:09 <alinefm> ok
14:23:11 <alinefm> done for that?
14:23:21 <samhenri> yes
14:23:27 <alinefm> moving to kimchi
14:23:29 <alinefm> - Live migration
14:23:40 <alinefm> I saw some emails in the ML about that
14:23:43 <alinefm> what is missing there?
14:23:45 <alinefm> danielhb, ^
14:24:16 <samhenri> well, i'm stuck with some environment issues
14:24:46 <samhenri> lbianc is helping me with that and once I figure this I'll resume working with the UI
14:25:21 <samhenri> the ui is finished, i just need to fix the Delete once the migration is finished and the passwordless login
14:27:12 <alinefm> ok
14:27:45 <alinefm> you can ping danielhb for help with the environment issues if you can not solve them soon
14:27:55 <samhenri> sure
14:28:03 <lbianc> alinefm: Ok, thanks!
14:28:05 <alinefm> - Memory hot plug
14:28:25 <alinefm> this is to enable the "Memory" edition when editing a running guest
14:28:27 <samhenri> we don't have any mockup for this
14:28:33 <samhenri> oh, ok
14:28:46 <samhenri> i was thinking that it would require a range slider
14:28:56 <samhenri> or numeric slider
14:28:59 <alinefm> it would be good to have too =)
14:29:09 <alinefm> we can discuss changes on that
14:29:59 <samhenri> ok, but first i need to know exactly how the rest api will be like
14:30:00 <alinefm> samhenri, for hotplug the memory slot must be 256 (correct, rotru ?)
14:30:20 <alinefm> samhenri, all the API is documented in docs/API.md
14:30:25 <samhenri> and for now when i try to edit a running guest I get some "ifaces" error
14:30:29 <alinefm> but ping me on problems to find it
14:30:43 <alinefm> samhenri, on which OS?
14:31:24 <samhenri> centos for sure, i think i saw on ubuntu 15.04
14:31:59 <alinefm> I strongly recommend to use the last version of Fedora, Ubuntu, openSUSE or RHEL
14:32:13 <alinefm> at least, those are the distro most tested by the community
14:32:28 <alinefm> so it means on ubuntu 15.10
14:32:42 <alinefm> Fedora 23, RHEL 7.2 or OpenSUSE LEAP 42.1
14:32:59 <alinefm> if the problem persists, please, open an issue on github
14:33:11 <alinefm> is this error blocking you for the memory hot plug devel?
14:33:12 <samhenri> yes
14:33:20 <samhenri> but i can confirm its only on centos
14:33:23 <samhenri> ubuntu running ifne
14:33:29 <samhenri> fine*
14:33:58 <alinefm> not too bad so =)
14:34:14 <samhenri> well, for now I'll just enable the input field them
14:34:23 <samhenri> then*
14:34:43 <alinefm> ok
14:34:59 <alinefm> -  Create storage volume when attaching disk to a guest
14:35:25 <alinefm> when attacking a new disk to a guest the user (today) must specify the pool and the volume
14:35:39 <alinefm> the volume must exist in the pool
14:36:00 <alinefm> with this feature the user will select the pool + size of volume and the volume will be created and attached to the guest
14:36:11 <alinefm> I think I have already sent some ideas for the UI in the ML
14:36:19 <alinefm> anything missing there?
14:36:45 <samhenri> i've searched the mockups and couldn't find them
14:37:40 <alinefm> from now on, there will be no mockups =D
14:37:55 <alinefm> we only provide suggestion in a text way
14:38:02 <samhenri> oh, great
14:39:04 <alinefm> do you have doubts about what we have suggested in the ML?
14:39:48 <samhenri> i think we don't need mockups in high fidelity but we sure need some wireframes
14:39:57 <samhenri> like the network modal windows for Ginger
14:39:58 <lbianc> alinefm: so here we would need kind of fields, where they will be placed, can someone do that?
14:40:12 <rotru> alinefm,  samhenri  slots are of 1GB
14:40:13 <alinefm> lbianc, it is already done
14:40:40 <alinefm> lbianc, I can find the link in the ML archives to you later, if you want
14:40:44 <lbianc> alinefm: where?
14:40:49 <lbianc> alinefm: yes, thanks
14:40:49 <alinefm> s/in the/to the
14:41:22 <samhenri> ok
14:41:35 <lbianc> alinefm: Wouldn't be better add a link ow a description on the todo list?
14:42:49 <alinefm> live migration UI proposal: http://lists.ovirt.org/pipermail/kimchi-devel/2015-November/012448.html
14:43:48 <samhenri> live migration is ok
14:45:22 <alinefm> create logical pool from existing VG: http://lists.ovirt.org/pipermail/kimchi-devel/2015-October/011988.html
14:48:36 <alinefm> I could not find the email for the disk yet
14:48:42 <samhenri> I have the RFC for Linux and OVS bridge here, no mockup / wireframe required
14:48:48 <alinefm> pvital, could you find that and resend to lbianc and samhenri?
14:49:06 <alinefm> I remember you sent that to the ML explaining the API and the UI proposal
14:49:28 <alinefm> samhenri, ok
14:49:33 <alinefm> any more doubts?
14:49:40 <alinefm> I need to go in some minutes
14:49:49 <samhenri> list view for Storage volumes we have two different mockups, but this we can discuss later
14:50:17 <alinefm> 2 different mockups in the new UI spec?
14:50:32 <samhenri> we have the pdf guide and the older ones that Susan sent
14:50:43 <alinefm> oh ok
14:50:55 <samhenri> the older mockups enable multi-select volumes
14:51:09 <lbianc> alinefm: can we add the links in the wiki for each item to pint to these discussions?
14:51:12 <alinefm> hrm... I don't think it is good to enable now
14:51:19 <lbianc> point*
14:51:22 <alinefm> as the whole app does not allow it yet
14:51:32 <alinefm> lbianc, feel free to edit the wiki
14:51:54 <lbianc> alinefm: ok :)
14:52:09 <samhenri> ok
14:52:19 <alinefm> samhenri, lbianc, are you done for today?
14:52:22 <alinefm> more questions?
14:52:24 <samhenri> Create UI support for creating template without specifying media type
14:53:29 <lbianc> alinefm: There are other items that we want to discuss, but probably you dont have tome for it now
14:53:30 <samhenri> and SR-IOV?
14:53:37 <lbianc> alinefm: Can we discuss it later?
14:53:43 <alinefm> please! =)
14:53:48 <alinefm> SRIOV is for ginger, right?
14:54:25 <samhenri> yes
14:55:05 <samhenri> but we can discuss this later
14:55:13 <alinefm> sure
14:55:24 <alinefm> but I think most of the specifications are done
14:55:35 <samhenri> ok
14:55:43 <alinefm> once we have all them done I will send a summary email to the ML
14:55:54 <alteodoro> ok
14:55:59 <alinefm> let's end the meeting for today
14:56:09 <lbianc> alinefm: OK, thanks!
